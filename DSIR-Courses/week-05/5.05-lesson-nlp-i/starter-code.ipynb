It's Chipotle, so you know you'll pay $8 (after tax) for a chicken bowl and be full and satisfied afterwards. \\n The employees are friendly and give generous portions. Seating is limited, but there is a place you can stand and eat near the window, which is where I always eat. I'm sitting down eight hours a day at the office anyway - standing and eating here is probably extending my lifespan. \\nThe line gets line long during lunch, but it moves fast. Dinner time is amazing - rarely a line and the portions are extra generous during this time.\\n This fairly new Chipotle is at a great location, near McPherson Square. It's right next to my office and gym so it's perfect for me. \\nBottom line: if you're craving Chipotle and are worried about the other reviews and low ratings for this location, don't be. It's my favorite Chipotle location in the DC area, and that's not an exaggeration.\"\n",

    "yelp_2 = \"DISGUSTING LONG HAIR THREADED THROUGH CHICKEN IN BURRITO BOWL.\\n There was a long blonde hair threaded through my chicken as I was eating a burrito bowl.  I did not notice until it was too late and the HAIR ENTERED MY MOUTH as I was eating and I grossly pulled the hair out.\\n I calmly walked up to the register to inform them that there was hair in my food. The register person was busy, I understand that, but I was promptly ignored like my issue was not a big deal.  He proceeded to get his manager, 'Leslie' I believe.  She was not apologetic at all and offered no condolences. She did however offer a refund, but I didn't care about the money, I just wanted to eat food without eating someone's hair as a side dish.\\n The second time I went back up, a different person, the general manager Peris, was more apologetic and handled the situation better. He ended up getting Leslie to file a report, but who knows if they submitted it or not.\\n Suffice to say, if you dont want food in your hair, dont eat here.\"\n",

    "yelp_3 = \"First time going to this Chipotle.  The line was very quick and the food was fresh.  But as I started eating a notice that the food was very salty.  I started separating my bowl after two bites.  I ordered a bowl with white rice, black beans, chicken, sour cream, cheese and lettuce.  I tasted everything separately.  Once I tasted the Chicken by it self it was unbearable.  It taste like someone pouring the entire bottle of salt on tge chicken.  I tried to take most the chicken out the bowl but still I could not bear the taste of the salt.  So I ended up throwing the damn bowl away.  $8.00 down the drain.  SMH.\""
