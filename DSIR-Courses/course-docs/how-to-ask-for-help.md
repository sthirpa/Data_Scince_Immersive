# Waht to do when stuck

Learning how to solve your own problems is a primary skill for a programmer or data scientist. 


## During a lesson

If you have a programming related lesson do the following:

1. Try to solve it yourself. Read the stack trace if it's an error. Look for a typo. Think about it.
1. If the class is moving on, and the problem will stop you from moving with them, Slack the IA on duty.
  - Phrase your question with as much information as possible. If you have the stack track for an error and your code, share those.
  - List what remedies you've tried.


## Outside class time
(Note: Per GA policy, instructors should not be expected to answer technical questions outside of class hours or office hours)
1. Try to solve it yourself. Read the stack trace if it's an error - especially the bottom of the error message. 
1. Look for a typo. Think about it.
1. Google search - favor recent results on Stack Overflow. Other good sources include Real Python, Data School, Machine Learning Mastery. 
1. Check out the docs.
1. Look at course materials.
1. Ask a friend.
1. If still stuck, set up an office hours appointment with instructional team or ping on Slack. 
1. Ask on Stack Overflow. See how to ask a good question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). 
1. Take a break. Go for a walk!
