# Predicting Health Care Costs Mini-hackathon Group Challenge

Have fun and develop your modeling skills! ðŸš€

## Goal

Predict `charges` using the other columns.

Make a model with the lowest RMSE on your randomly determined 25% of the test (holdout) set, without any data leakage. 


## Instructions

Use GridSearchCV and any of the following models you like:

- LinearRegression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- ElasticNet
- KNeighborsRegressor  

- You can make as many models as you like.
- You can use a pipline if you like.
- Does your model beat a null baseline model?
- The data is in the `data` folder.
- Use `22` for the `random_state` anytime you have randomization.
- You will have at least 90 minutes to work on this project. The exact stopping time will be shared in Slack at least 15 minutes prior to the stopping time. 
- Very brief (2-3 min), informal presentations will follow. No slides.


### Advice:
- Inference is not the goal today.
- Get a basic model working quickly. Then iterate. 

### Have fun and good luck! ðŸ˜€
