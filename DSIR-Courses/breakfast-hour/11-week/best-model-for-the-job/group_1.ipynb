They are looking to begin a paid advertising campaign to target new consumers, but want to understand the difference between successful and missed conversions. After your modeling is done you will be asked to present results to the marketing team that will help them pick the right new customers to target.\n",

You've been tasked by the director of the Underwriting division to create a model that will help underwriters triage fire insurance contracts by making a prediction, based on the insurance contract application, of the expected claim costs over the course of a contract. Due to extensive industry regulation and the fact that business may be rejected on the basis of your model, it must be possible to justify the model's predictions to regulators. The director would like a recommendation of three models and their relative pros and cons in the context of this business problem. \n",
