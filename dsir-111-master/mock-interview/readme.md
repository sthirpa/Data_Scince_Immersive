In order to see if Conglomo is the place for you we'll have you go through our Candidate Ranking Application Program. This consists of the following steps:

### **Screener Call**
Here you'll speak with one of our recruiter to hear more about your background and the journey that brought you Conglom-O

### **Technical Interview**
If you make it to the next round you'll speak to the Hiring Manager that will dig into some of your Data Science chops.

### **The Assessment**
If the Hiring Manager likes what you see you'll be given the opportunity to work on some real life Conglom-O data to really show us what you've got.

### **The Cut**
Once you've submitted your assessment we'll review all your materials and decide if you're right for the Conglomo-O family. Good luck!
