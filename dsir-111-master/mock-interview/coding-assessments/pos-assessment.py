Level 1 - Programming
You are a data scientist for a large retail organization. Currently your task involves mining for insights from Point-of_Sale systems which track item sales. You have data stored
as follos in JSON files (for simplicity think that you have one file 'pos_data.json')
Data Sample:
[{'item': 'Stella Extra Strong', 'price': '$23.45'},
{'item': 'Fosters Mild', 'price': '$12.99'},
{'item': 'Heineken', 'price': '$29.45'},
{'item': 'Stella Extra Strong', 'price': '$23.45'},
{'item': 'Stella Extra Strong', 'price': '$23.45'},
{'item': 'Fosters Mild', 'price': '$12.99'}]
Your tasks are as follows.
1. Write code to read in the JSON file to an appropriate python data structure (to solve Q2)
2. Use base python libraries (not pandas) to get the following insights
 -> Item name with top total sales
 -> Item name with least total sales
 -> Item name with the most units sold
Base Python libraries only (no 3rd party libraries e.g: numpy, pandas)
