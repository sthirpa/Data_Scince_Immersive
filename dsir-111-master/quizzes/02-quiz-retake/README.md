## Task
You are interviewing with a car company who is interested in hiring a data scientist to help them improve the fuel efficiency of their cars. As part of the interview process, they task you with the challenge to see which car qualities have the biggest impact on predicting miles per gallon (mpg). Your job is to predict the mpg given information about the car.

The dataset provided is from the [UCI open dataset list](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The data dictionary for the dataset is below:

Variable Name | Description | Units
--- | --- | ---
cylinders | number of [cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_%28engine%29) the car has | discrete number
displacement | [engine displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement) | cubic inches
horsepower | [engine power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower) of the car | horsepower
weight | weight of car | pounds
acceleration | elapsed time to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour | seconds
mpg | Target variable | [mpg](https://www.kbb.com/what-is/mpg/)

The notebook in this repository contains 5 parts with directions within each part. You are to clone this repository and fill in the quiz with your answers, taking special care to follow the directions _exactly_.

To **submit** your quiz, drop your completed notebook in the file uploader in the provided Google Form.

## Quiz Information
- This is an "open book" quiz - you may use any resources! This includes Jupyter notebooks, Google, StackOverflow, and your notes. ANY RESOURCE YOU USE MUST BE CITED (comment your code with links, which lesson you got the inspiration from, etc.) and failure to cite resources you use will be considered plagiarism.
- You may NOT work with anyone else on this quiz (your classmates, your instructor, etc.).
- You will have one hour to take this quiz.
- Do your best and good luck!

## Learning Targets Assessed
You should be able to:
- Perform basic data cleaning and EDA
- Describe a dataset, including data types, missing values and basic descriptive statistics
- Generate data visualizations
- Fit, generate predictions from, and evaluate a linear regression model
- Interpret the results and coefficients of a linear regression model

## Motivation
In many data science interviews, you will be required to complete a technical test or take-home assignment. These are often in the form of a coding challenge or a task given for you to complete within a certain amount of time. These quizzes are designed to mimic that process to prepare you to be successful during the interview process.
