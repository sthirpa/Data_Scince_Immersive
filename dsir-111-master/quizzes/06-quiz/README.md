## Instructions
Your task for Quiz 6 is to solve the following coding challenge. You are to upload your code in any format you would like (.ipynb, .py, etc.) to the Google Classroom assignment as your solution/submission.

**Important**: You are **not** allowed to use any outside resources on this quiz! See the Quiz Information section for more details.

## Task
Suppose a number can be said to have a "13-snippet" if there is a consecutive sequence of digits whose sum is 13. For example, the number 43917 has a single 13-snippet:

4<b><ins>391</ins></b>7

Some numbers can be shown to have more than one 13-snippet, such as 3472041:

3<b><ins>472</ins></b>041  
3<b><ins>4720</ins></b>41  
34<b><ins>7204</ins></b>1

Write a function that takes in a number n and returns `True` if there is a 13-snippet in the number. If there is not a 13-snippet in the number, the function should return `False`.

## Quiz Information
- This is a "closed book" quiz - you may **NOT** use any resources! This includes other code files, Google, StackOverflow, your notes, your classmates, your instructor, or anyone else. Use of any outside resources on this quiz will be considered plagiarism.
- You will have 30 minutes to take this quiz.
- Do your best and good luck!

## Learning Targets Assessed
You should be able to:
- Solve complex Python challenges

## Motivation
In many data science interviews, you will be required to complete a technical test or take-home assignment. These are often in the form of a coding challenge or a task given for you to complete within a certain amount of time. These quizzes are designed to emulate that process to prepare you to be successful during the interview process.
