    "# Introduction to Pickling\n",
    "\n",

    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn what serialization and deserialization are\n",
    "- Learn what \"pickling\" is in Python\n",
    "- Review using `with` statements to safely handle file operations\n",
    "- Pickle and unpickle scikit-learn models in Python\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is pickling?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're talking about food, pickling is a method of preserving food for the future. If you're talking about Python, pickling is a method of preserving **objects** for the future, including functions and classes. Since sklearn models are instances of classes, they can be pickled.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pickle an object, it needs to be **serialized**. Serialization is when we transform an object into byte streams. (Byte streams are collections of bytes. One byte is made up of eight zeros or ones.) To unpickle an object so that it can be used in Python again, it needs to be **deserialized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever saved your progress in a video game, you've already serialized data without knowing it. A save file is your serialized save state. When you load the save, you deserialize the data so you can resume the game right where you were before you quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some warnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you can't open a [Pokemon: Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) savefile in [Pokemon: Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sun_and_Moon), you have to unpickle an object in the same version of Python that you pickled it in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pickle objects can contain malicious code**. Never unpickle an object you don't trust!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why pickle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling makes a lot of sense any time you have a model you want to work with that you don't want to refit. Today, we'll pickle a fitted pipeline so that we can import it into a Streamlit web app, but pickling is useful in many other situations as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a model that took twelve hours to fit, you might want to analyze its residuals, work with its coefficients, or make predictions off of it. But without saving it some fashion, you'd need to refit the model every time you restarted your notebook. Pickling the model allows you to load the fitted model _without_ needing to re-run the code where you fit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Pickling does **not** compress your model, meaning that some pickled models can end up being fairly large file sizes. Think of K-nearest neighbors, which requires every data point to be stored inside the model (though sklearn _does_ optimize the way the data is stored for speed and efficiency, models can still be large.) \n",
    "- Keras has its own [`save` method](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize) on models. If you want to save a neural network fit in keras, use that instead of pickle.\n",
    "- Don't pickle data frames. Export them as csv files instead. Generally, if there's another way to save something, use it.\n",

The TF-IDF thus weights words by both the **term frequency**, which is the number of times the word is used in the document, and the **inverse document frequency**, which measures how important a term is across the corpus. To compute the TF-IDF of one word used in one document, we divide the term frequency by the inverse document frequency. We do this for each word in each document.\n",
