    "<img src=\"assets/herokunutshell.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options for how to use the service, but we just need a basic \"dyno\", which is effectively a server with a backend. This allows us to respond to user form input and serve dynamically rendered HTML websites.\n",

    "### Do I need to pay for this service?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the bare minimum single \"dyno\", which is free. However the more users access your application, the more work Heroku has to do to serve your content, so there is a limit.\n",
    "- <img src=\"assets/hours.JPG\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "- Additionally, if the \"dyno\" becomes inactive for 5 minutes (as in no one is accessing the application), the application will go to sleep. The next time a user tries to access the application, Heroku will spin up a new instance, which can take some time (30+ seconds).\n",
