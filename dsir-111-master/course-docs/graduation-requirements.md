As data scientists, you will be expected to have many skills developed. Employers are looking for candidates who:
- Demonstrate technical proficiency from defining the business problem and gathering data to building and evaluating models.
- Confidently speak in depth about the technical choices made.
- Communicate competently to non-technical audiences.
- Write clearly about the work they do.
- Recognize how their work impacts real-world decisions and stakeholders.

It's not enough to simply develop these skills; you also have to **show employers** that you've mastered these skills!

At General Assembly, we'll spend the next twelve weeks working with you to develop these skills and showcase them to a variety of audiences.

*To graduate from the Data Science Immersive program with General Assembly and receive your certificate of completion, by stated deadlines you must*:
- Meet all attendance requirements.
- Satisfactorily complete 80% of all homework assignments, consisting of labs, blog posts, and assessments.
- Satisfactorily complete all projects.
- Pay your tuition in full.
- Satisfactorily meet outcomes requirements.

### 1. Attendance
While attendance is in general important, being present throughout an immersive experience is critical for success. Consider a standard three-credit college course. This is usually associated with three hours in class per week over a period of a semester... so about 40 hours in class. The Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly is a 480-hour course, or equivalent to about twelve college classes. This doesn't take into account the nights and weekends you'll likely spend on coursework. In order to successfully make it through this course, being late or absent considerably affects your ability to keep up with the class.

- Students are allowed up to 3 excused absences over the course.
- 3 tardies or 3 early departures = 1 absence.
- Students who are absent are responsible for connecting with their instructional team to catch up on what they missed.

### 2. Satisfactorily complete 80% of all homework.
Homework is a broad category that is a combination of labs, blog posts, and assessments.

- **Labs** will be the most common method of evaluation - there will be approximately two to three labs each week. It is our expectation that you complete each lab to the best of your ability. All labs are graded pass/fail. Turn in your labs in Google Classroom and push all work to your GitHub submission folder. You may resubmit labs that are not completed/do not pass. We strongly urge you to stay up with lab work to help you learn the concepts of the course.
- **Six quiz assessments** will be administered throughout the course. Quizzes are designed to simulate interview questions and give us an opportunity to gauge progress. Quizzes will be graded pass/fail. If you do not initially pass a quiz or cannot take the quiz on the day schedule, you will have the opportunity to retake a similar quiz in order to achieve a passing score without penalty. If you pass a retake; it is as if you passed the original quiz.
- **Blog posts** are a way for you to share your experiences, to get noticed, and to communicate your understanding of data science to the world. Many successful data scientists have and regularly publish on blogs. Many data scientists have blogs as a way to communicate with the data science community. You are expected to complete four data science-related blog posts by the date of graduation. Not sure where to start? Check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhY7vHDX5oHlR-pq3C85jr_yHU-o0idr0WvwKIBf4cU/edit?usp=sharing). All blog posts must be at least 1,000 words and be something you would want a potential employer to view.

**You must satisfactorily complete 80% of all assigned labs, blog posts, and quizes to be eligible to graduate.

### 3. Satisfactorily complete all projects.
You'll hear more details about these later, but you'll complete a series of projects designed to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science "pipeline" - from data collection to exploratory data analysis to modeling to writing up and presenting results. The requirements for each project will vary and be specified when each project is announced. Projects tend to be the most time-consuming component of the course, so it is always advised that you start early! You may ask for an extension on a maximum of one individual project. We strongly recommend you try to not to use this option.

### 4. Tuition
Tuition must be paid in full by the end of the course to receive a letter of completion (unless final payments are scheduled after end of course).

### 5. Outcomes Requirements
Outcomes requirements for post-graduation support are explicitly laid out in the Outcomes materials. Note that you are not eligible for post-graduation support without satisfactorily completing all above requirements.

*To earn post-graduation Outcomes support, you must*:
- Receive your certificate of completion. (Meet all above requirements.)
- Satisfactorily compile a portfolio.
- Satisfactorily complete your Brand Statement.
- Satisfactorily complete your LinkedIn Profile.
- Satisfactorily complete your resume.
- Satisfactorily complete your GA Profile.
- Satisfactorily complete all professional connections / networking requirements.
- Satisfactorily complete your personal job tracker.
