# Blog Posts

Blog posts are a way for you to share your experiences, to get noticed, and to communicate your understanding of data science to the world. Many successful data scientists have and regularly publish on blogs. Many data scientists have blogs as a way to communicate with the data science community. You are expected to complete four data science-related blog posts by the date of graduation. Not sure where to start? We have some suggestions below. All blog posts must be at least 1,000 words and be something you would want a potential employer to view. 

### Suggested Topics:
