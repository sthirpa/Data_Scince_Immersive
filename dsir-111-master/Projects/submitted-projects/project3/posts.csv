In celebration of this milestone we are going to do a blockchain based giveaway with prizes of:

1. 5000 MOONs and special flair
2. 3000 MOONs
3. 2000 MOONs

These MOONs will be distributed by [u/TheMoonDistributor](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheMoonDistributor/), so they will carry voting weight in this subreddit's governance polls.

All  you need to do to participate in this giveaway is leave one top-level comment on this post that starts with a number between 0-1048575. After you write your guess for a number you can write whatever else you wish, but please put your number/guess first. For instance, your comment could  be:

&gt;42069 blablablabla

or

&gt;1337  
&gt;  
&gt;blabla  
&gt;  
&gt;blablabla

or just

&gt;420420

That's it, although there are two other rules:

1. You have to make your single guess/comment before 2021/12/06 23:59 UTC (that's just before midnight on Monday night UTC time)
2. Do **NOT** edit your comment at any point

The  winners will be selected based on whose guess is closest to the last  five characters of the hash of Bitcoin block #712948, which should occur  sometime on morning of Tuesday the 7th UTC time. For instance, the hash of block 712444 is:

&gt;0000000000000000000993242224e33c179bca1624799e8466d4ad53c2d8c265

So the last five characters are ""8c265"", which if we convert to decimal is  574,053. If there are multiple winners exactly as close we will award the full prize to both/all.

Good luck!",CryptoCurrency

Nothing on the news extraordinary, not politics, not SEC, not Congress, China, India, Elon or anyone else.

We dipped. Dipped hard. Just goes to show that whoever is saying on socials they know shit about crypto, just means they are using open sentences to describe the daily outlook. And we are consumers, we consume this garbage on the daily.

Consuming content, news, tweets, memes, brain farts and everything else these crypto tech geniuses are spitting out. For what?

I was also on leverage and lost over 5 digits but I still have some crypto that is not in leverage. Even someone who is bullish can also be destroyed in this type of environment.

Personally, I have learn to reduce my leverage trading and focus more on holding it for the long term. 

Stay strong folks, we are going to be there for each other in this dips. I‚Äôll be honest, this dip is making me panic inside and a slide PTSD from 2017 crash. If you ever need help, do not be afraid to talk to your love ones or even call the hotline for help!

But, would you be able to hold them through such high volatility over the years?

If you want to become rich, you need to believe in a project, put your money and then be patient for years. This means you need to hodle through the storm and ride out the waves. You need to be able to control your emotions.

If you are panicking right now because of this minor crash, you would have definitely panicked during all the minor flash crashes that happened in the past years too. You would not have been able to hold on to your BTC.

If you believe in BTC, ETH and other strong projects, dips and crashes are buying opportunities. Not the time to panic sell.

BTC and ETH have stood the test of time. They are here to stay. Longterm holding will bring your fortunes. Panic selling will drill a hole in your pocket.

DCA, Hodle and Chill. That's how you beat the the algorithms, high frequency traders, sudden liquidations, and flash crashes.

Edit: pls stop buying, price is going up again. I'm trying to buy to help you guys exit at a good price is all (you're welcome) but crypto is definetly dead. Please sell and continue to panic. Panic helps you make the right decision to sell and is definetly not good for me.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8uppr,Influencers were predicting 100k BTC because that's what you wanted to hear,"I saw a lot of posts yesterday complaining about wild predictions not coming to fruition. Multiple crypto-influencers were predicting Bitcoin would be above 100k before the end of the year, and as it's not likely to happen after that nasty crash, some people are mad.

But here's the thing : **talking heads are making crazy predictions because it's what we, as a community, want to hear**.

We want to be comforted about our investment choices, so we only listen to the voices that are churning out bullish news and insane price targets. On the other hand, down-to-earth influencers, or those warning us crypto markets movements are famously hard to predict, are ignored, while those with rocket emojis in their YouTube thumbnails are racking up millions of views for their videos.

Here is the truth : when it comes to short-term prediction, **absolutely nobody has any clue about anything**. We can try to predict where the market is heading (I tried it myself a few times), but to give a precise target such as ""BTC 100k EOY!"" is just non-sense. You could end up being right, or entirely wrong.

That's why I try to stay away from all that noise. I choose solid projects, I DCA, I stake when possible and I relax. It's really not that complicated. I still keep small bags of various alts, just in case, but the bulk of my money is into ETH. Of course, I won't give you a price target today, but I am still certain that, in ten years, ETH will have more value then today.

So, here's my tip : get in with a strategy, and stick to it, while ignoring price predictions, TA and influencers. Long-term, you'll be happier, and possibly richer.",CryptoCurrency

People who say ""buy the dip"" on this subreddit are literally in it for themselves, they hope that people will see their hopium-titled thread and suddenly the market will go back to normal.

t3_r8djp9,What happened to the $100k BTC by the end of the year prediction everyone was saying?,"A few months ago it seemed like everyone influential in crypto was predicting $100k BTC by the end of the year. However, it doesn't look like that's going to happen with the state of the market at the moment. It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC's market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:

1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. 

2.) The ""so called"" experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they're talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.

3.) Technical analysis in crypto can only tell you so much. Essentially, everybody (including the ""experts"") knows shit about fuck, and you're much better doing your own research than investing based on what these bozos say.

t3_r8olna,Yes this is a crash. Yes this when you buy.,"I'm no expert but the idea of accumulating a crypto is simple. You try to accumulate whatever it is at the lowest prices consistently or whenever you can. If you're here to make quick cash then, this ain't your day. But if you're here because you always had no intention of selling regardless, then it's just another exciting day in crypto.

Your not going to get rich with a coin like ETH or BTC that's going to continue to just rise. You gotta hope, pray, wish for a crash to buy into. If I followed this rule in May I would have 3-4x my money today.

Perhaps we‚Äôll drop a bit more again before we hit 50k but to me this seems incredibly bullish.

I'm also slightly concerned about this though. BTC has been in the red for most of the month (Nov 4th to Dec 4th) and it's just been a steady decrease.

t3_r8w8ms,If Bitcoin can survive 2014 then nothing can kill it (especially not this little mini crash),"I first got into Bitcoin in December 2017 and quickly saw the awful collapse of 2018 - 2020 Bear market. But during that time of January 2018 I really started to research Bitcoins history and technology and I really fell in love. Now this post wont be about the technology since we already have plenty talking about it but instead we'll talk about the history. Specifically the year 2014.

**When Shit Hits The Fan**
 
 - Mt Gox gets hacked

A lot of new people might not understand it but Mt Gox was the biggest Bitcoin Exchange at the time accounting for **70%** of all Bitcoin volume at the time. Imagine bigger than Coinbase and Binance combined. A lot of people lost everything and its hard to keep people motivated in the technology when they no longer have the thousands in it they once had. Even worse all their money belongs to a hacker now who will benefit the most from bitcoin adoption.

 - Bit License

New York City creates the Bit License. One of the most repressive regulations the crypto market has seen. Back then a lot of Bitcoin startups were in New York City and this Bit license regulation shut down a huge portion of the Bitcoin startups at the time. Even throwing in jail some of the more high profile people in Bitcoin at the time over weird technicalities. 

This crack down really hurt a lot if innovation and real world adoption that Bitcoin was going through at the time. Creating the biggest government hurdle that Bitcoin had to face yet. Nobody knew if Bitcoin would survive this. They were only a 1 Billion dollar asset at the time and there was no guarantee of network effect to withstand this kind of attack.   

 - Silk Road Shutdown

In late 2013 Silk Road was shutdown. It was the biggest real world use case for Bitcoin at the time. Since it was the first dark web marketplace to accept Bitcoin and then subsequently was shut down. A lot of people believed that was it for Bitcoin on the dark web. nobody new that a bunch of copycats would emerge over the years to pick up the mantle. All they new was that Silk Road was gone and with it the biggest real world use case for Bitcoin was taken too.

 - Blocksize wars 

Satoshi had left the project in 2011 but by 2014 Bitcoin was really starting to feel the loss of its figurehead when it came to the block size debate. Satoshi's word was almost like gospel back then. Anytime the blockchain needed an important decision or an emergency fix Satoshi was always there to lead the way. But now Satoshi had been gone for 3 years and the Block size debate was getting extremely divisive and personal.

Now I wont get into the benefits of both sides of the war since this post is about history and not technicals. But the main take away is that the community was divided in two and it was only going to get worse. leading to the Bitcoin Cash fork that split off half of the community. 

**Conclusion**
 
Add all this together with Bitcoin going down 90% from a high of 1k to a low of $100 then it seems like Bitcoin is bound to die... that is until it didn't. The next halving cycle came and Bitcoin shot up to the infamous 20k of the 2017 Bull cycle before crashing down again. In conclusion, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. not from the 2018 crash, not from this crash, and not from the 2026 crash. If Bitcoin can survive 2014 then Bitcoin can survive anything.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8ogr2,Could We Have Predicted This Dump? Look at ETH/BTC,"There are many technical indicators that I use when I trade/invest in crypto.  One useful indicator is ETH/BTC ratio.  In general, I don't really pay attention to any alts/BTC ratio except for (1) BTC dominance (2) ETH/BTC and (3) LTC/BTC.  We will discuss ETH/BTC below.

1. **What is ETH/BTC?**  ETH/BTC is simply the ratio between price of 1 ETH and price of 1 BTC.  Given that BTC has always been more expensive than ETH, ETH/BTC &lt; 1 and in most cases come between 0.02 and 0.10.  Qualitatively speaking, it reveals information about strength about ETH vs strength about BTC.
2. **When ETH/BTC is high, markets tend to dump.**  ETH/BTC had its peak at around February of 2018 (end of the last bull market) when it peaked at around 0.12.  For those of you who were around that time, this was the time when BTC was starting to look weak but ETH was flourishing (similar environment to right now).  And this concept of ""flippening"" started to take on a meme value in forums such as this one, where flippening refers to the process in which ETH overtakes BTC as the #1 crypto in the market.  In retrospect, that was the end of the bull cycle run as BTC faltered even further and soon afterwards, ETH tumbled down as well, while ETH/BTC went down dramatically for the rest of the 2018.
3. **So what about 2021?**  ETH/BTC hit some local peak values on couple of occasions:  (1) middle of May at 0.0824 (2) early September at 0.0795 and (3) present time at 0.083.  In all three cases after ETH/BTC hit its peak, BTC went down from 58K to 30K in mid May, 52K to 39K in early September, and 57 to 42K (and even lower?) right now.  So there is a lot of supporting data that an abnormally high ETH/BTC means that market is about to dump.
4. **So why does the market dump when ETH/BTC is high?**  This is my speculation.  ETH/BTC being high means that ETH is strong but more importantly, it means that BTC is weak.  So BTC is very vulnerable, but high ETH/BTC would also entail that the market prices in general is inflated.  As such, this is the type of condition that leads to a massive dump of the market.  And unfortunately, ETH has an asymmetric relationship with BTC in the sense that ETH cannot flourish when BTC is struggling (whereas BTC can flourish even when ETH is struggling).
5. **So what should I do the next time ETH/BTC is high?**  The smart thing is to start selling off your position and wait for the dump.  You would have benefitted from doing this in February of 2018, May of 2021, Sept of 2021, and present time.  And this indicator is something that builds up slowly so you have ample amount of time to react.  In this weird sense, if you are just trading using the ETH/BTC indicator and not HODLing, you don't have to even buy Bitcoin.  The simple strategy would be to buy ETH when ETH/BTC is low and sell to stablecoins when ETH/BTC is high.  It is weird that if you trade using soley this indicator, your portfolio would always be x% ETH and 100-x% stablecoins.  BTC would just be a useful index here.   And if you backward test this simple method, it would be insanely profitable. 

Hope you find this useful.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8ru9a,An old timer's perspective,"I just want to say that these hundreds of Youtube channels with some 20 year old doing their technical analysis charts on various cryptos have had me laughing my ass off for the past year. They're trying to apply the same TA parameter rules of an asset class that has been around for a hundred years+ (stocks) to an asset class that is really still in its infancy (crypto). 

I've been around for stock market crashes like 2002, 2008 and previous crypto crashes. Bought BTC in 2017 and then saw it go down to about $3000).

A couple of things to remember.

In the stock market you're lucky if you double your money in 10 years, in crypto you can 10x your money in a few days. (I've done it myself with LRC) So you need to realize that the reverse is also true and not bet the farm with money that you can't afford to lose.

Next, When the sh\*t hits the fan, EVERYTHING IS CORRELATED. For example, If the stock market takes a major sh\*t because of Covid fears or out of control interest rates, you can be 99% sure that BTC and ETH will follow, and in turn every alt coin will follow those two. Are you in for the long term? With real projects with a use case, not Santa Claus coin/cute doggie coin that serves no purpose? Then this is just noise. In the long term there will be a recovery and in increase from the previous ATH's

My current portfolio is BTC, ETH and a few alts that I feel are legit projects (ADA, XLM, LRC) What am I doing today?  I'm looking to dip my toe in on some of the lower cap alts that I don't have and felt I'd missed out on. Some of these are down like 20-25% today and I feel the bounce back in a recovery could be (percentage wise) better than that of the two big guys, BTC and ETH.  I grabbed some ALGO and AVAX, and increased my position in ADA.

t3_r8ybgm,"Since its lowest point today, the total crypto market cap has recovered by about 400 billion dollars, or 21%. The entire market has grown by over one fifth since the bottom of the wick 15 hours ago.","At its lowest point today, the total crypto market cap according to TradingView's daily chart was $1.855 trillion, which is $553 billion below the daily open. At its lowest point, today's total market cap daily candle represented a 23% loss. The entire market was down by nearly a quarter.

At the time of writing, we have risen from that low by $400 billion, or 21%. With less than 4 hours left until the daily close, we are only about 6.1% down for total market cap for the day.

I'm not saying we are out of the woods yet, or that today has not been a big deal. But there is still hope that the correction we have been in for 24 days is basically a September-scale correction, rather than a May-scale correction (or even worse, the cyclic crash into the coming bear market).

We still have a ways to go to neutralize the -6.1% that we are sitting at for the day, but a -6.1% day is still a hell of a ways up from a -23% day.

PS: If you think my math doesn't add up because it seems like a 23% drop plus a 21% rise shouldn't leave us 6.1% down, just remember that, for example, you need 100% gains to recover a 50% loss, and you need 33% gains to recover a 25% loss.

t3_r8iycx,Reason why Bitcoin might be crashing,"I was just checking the BTC dominance and it is at \~42%. It hasn't moved at all. This is strange because we had a standard -20 to -30% correction. Almost all Alts have bleed against BTC so unless there has been some flippening it dosn't add up

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/)

People are selling their Alts for fiat. While BTC is being accumulated with amount on exchanges at ATL; 6.2%

[https://www.viewbase.com/exchange](https://www.viewbase.com/exchange)

On chain analysis shows that most BTC address are becoming HODLers. With OTC desks now accounting for nearly \~80% of BTC trade

So we have:

1. 6.2% of BTC on exchanges
2. Of that 6.2% most are HODLers
3. 80% of trading is via OTC limiting price impact
4. Alts bleeding against BTC but no movement in dominance

So who is selling BTC?

The answer is no one?

In simplest terms centralized exchanges; most likely Binance, Kucoin and Bitfinex are selling thin air via USDT backed leveraged trading. On Bitfinex alone ETH and BTC shorts are over 2 billion

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/)

But you asking yourself why would these shorts effect price so much?. They don't themselves but in combination with spot leveraged trading and USDT backed printed reserves. They create fictitious BTC balances in their users accounts

By which I mean that Tearher prints USDT to cover gaps in accounts on Binance and co. While Binance then leverages those amounts on trades. Creating fictitious BTC trades. With no real BTC being traded. Based on the open intrest and liquidations with no movement in BTC

I estimate that at least 60% to 70% of all BTC being traded is fictitious

This is in line with a past study that suggested that nearly 95% of trades where fictitious: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html)

However now with the aid of USDT those trades are trapping fiat in exchanges. Not just bogus limit orders to fatten the order books

If I'm even remotely correct it would mean that Binance is most likely insolvent. They are holding a huge amount of worthless USDT: [https://coinranking.com/coin/HIVsRcGKkPFtW+tetherusd-usdt](https://coinranking.com/coin/HIVsRcGKkPFtW+tetherusd-usdt)

As Binance at $28 billion USDT trading volume is 3x the next exchange

This USDT not their own BUSD is what is covering the fictitious BTC that they are trading. As in actuality Binance only holds $15 billion ( \~292k BTC) of which as discussed isn't being traded by the users.

[https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-coldwallet](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-coldwallet)

They most likely:

1. Started ""lending"" out users balances and displayed fictitious amounts in accounts
2. Due to supply shock started fractional accounts. Partially backed by USDT. E.g USDT supply increase correlated with BTC outflows from exchanges
3. Now actully are highly insolvent in both actual BTC and fiat. Holding mainly USDT

To clarify when I mean partially backed by USDT I mean that on Binance if your account says 2 BTC. You can only withdraw 1 BTC at most. The other BTC doesn't exist it's a fictitious BTC created by USDT backed trades on the platform.

Therefore if an actual parabolic run where to occur. It would be the worst case scenario for these exchanges. As they don't actully have the fiat or crypto to cover the withdrawals

If BTC when to $100k and people started wanting to exit. They wouldn't be able to exit in fiat but only USDT which is functionally useless outside the fictitious BTC scam. Of the decided to withdraw BTC from Binance to US backed ones such as Kraken and Coinbase it would be the same.

This is why \~ 80% of BTC trade is now OTC

So it is to the benefit of centralized exchanges to keep the price if BTC artificially low. Done through mass liquidations that reduce pressure on the system.

It is my belief that on May 19th 2021 it was the near collapse of this system that caused both the crash and the outages on exchanges. Totaling $1 trillion in value to be lost in hours",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8sxpw,I studied the Metaverse for 8 years and here's what I concluded:,"# Preface:

The Metaverse is a hypothetical version of the internet in which 3D avatars navigate a 3D space. Companies envision this world to be one where most people will live most of the most meaningful parts of their life in the future.

# 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard

As Metaverse enthusiasts, it's important to remember that we are likely the top 0.1% of computer users. Most people are confused by technology, overwhelmed by options and worried if they push the wrong button they will destroy something.

Chrome added a copy and paste feature to the menu because [people couldn't discover](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/only-one-in-10-know-what-ctrlf-does--here-are-shortcuts-you-should-know-20111130-1o69d.html) how to copy and paste.

Since the Metaverse simulates the countless possibilities of physical life, the complexity of the user interface gets out of hand quickly.

I remember testing out Second Life and accidentally taking off my pants and being unable to put them back on for 20 minutes.

Clearly, mouse and keyboard would not be a sufficient way of interacting with the metaverse.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space

18 years ago, Second Life came out and the hype around the Metaverse future was just as real back then as it is today. You can visit the empty government buildings, brand showcases and  cities to get a taste of the forgotten glory.

Time and time again people have been put together in a virtual space, and we still went back to physical life for real connections.

We have to ask ourselves, why did we leave virtual worlds and go back to physical life?

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships

The great benefits of any relationship are usually found in the most challenging operations of cooperation, marriage is a great example. Dating is exciting but sharing a life with someone is deeply sacrificial and yet, the benefits of marriage are enormous.

In  digital worlds we scarcely invest as heavily in relationships as in physical life. When we can go anywhere, be with anyone it's easy to constantly look for greener grass.

This problem is accentuated by the ability to change your name/avatar at will. When people can burn others and simply change their identity to escape consequences, they do. Investing in a real reputation and a single identity is the first step to solving this issue.

# 

# 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world

In digital worlds, we find ourselves mixed in with people from different cultures who have different values and interests. By contrast, in physical life we are naturally segmented with people who are more likely to share our values and ideas.

Gaming has the power to break ice between people and therefore has intrinsic utility to the Metaverse.

By using gamification we can organize and connect people of similar interests and values in a virtual space.

Not only that, gaming has the power to get people to relax. Human beings don‚Äôt develop meaningful friendships when forced into it. This is what social games and ‚Äúvirtual life‚Äù games often get wrong. Actual gameplay builds the context we need to relax and have a conversation to find people we are compatible with.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior

If you've ever lifted a baby and smiled at it, you know that facial expressions are deeply embedded in how we communicate. When we hurt someone's feelings, their facial expressions changes and, as we reciprocate their facial expressions, our body produces the same emotions as we make that individual feel. This acts as a natural tempering of our behaviour that we don't get when we communicate over the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world

A long time ago, there was a single company that dominated the telephone market. To call anybody who was the customer of the company you needed to have a phone that was with that same company, phones were not interoperable. Today, if you want to contact somebody on Facebook, you need Facebook to do so. This is how social networks defend their intellectual property.

‚ÄúThe first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,‚Äù Rubin wrote. ‚ÄúWe must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.‚Äù - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/30/facebooks-meta-mission-was-laid-out-in-a-2018-paper-on-the-metaverse.html)

The network effect is a scary prospect because it means that there will likely be only one Metaverse to rule them all in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. Customization is the enemy of usability

It's fascinating to bump into so many people who share the idea that no corporation should control the future of human interaction. However, it's laughable that we're using the same ill-advised ideas that allowed Facebook, Google and apps to dominate when it comes to this next chapter.

One of the reasons that Facebook overtook MySpace was that MySpace allowed people to customize their profile infinitely. This led to a myriad of different user interfaces, confusing navigation and a poor user experience.

Just imagine a myriad of virtual worlds all with their own user interface, controls and standards. The experience of travelling from world to world would be like being born all over again and having to learn how to read and write.

Therefore, the virtual world must have a single user experience to reach mass adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare

As the network effect brings everyone to a single Metaverse, the potential for the abuse of power will be astronomical. The Metaverse will understand where you are, who you are with and even what you look at.

AI will be able to process that data to better understand you than you yourself and data is the first step toward oppression.

Utilizing all this data, powerful individuals will have the ability to suppress dissent, identify people of contrarian opinion etc.

Moreover, if we begin to fool ourselves that we can agree on morals and values, those who [disagree with the mainstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) will live in constant fear of losing their friends, job and opportunities if they are banned from the Metaverse.

# 9. We can create a more ethical Metaverse future if we act now:

I sincerely believe that once the technology is established, and a real sense of presence can be found in a virtual world, the Metaverse will be inevitable.

Just imagine a world in which we do not need to build offices or school buildings oh, the cost savings themselves will drive people to virtual worlds if they have life-like fidelity.

I would like to start an initiative to ensure the Metaverse remains controlled by those who use it. In fact, I started a few years ago.

# The plan:

1. Make a game studio
2. Learn the ideal psychology to create real social organization in a virtual space
3. Start a collaborative movement to create a real Metaverse by the people and for the people

To be clear, what we're seeking to spark off is not another crypto/NFT thing but a place most ordinary gamers would play. Monetization can be focused on later.

t3_r8vy7b,"Don't get sucked into playing the game of ""Crypto Time Machine.""","""Crypto Time Machine"" is my term for the mental trap of ""*if only I had known*"" that people get carried away with.

*If only I had known* that BTC was destined for greatness back when faucets gave them for free.

*If only I had known* Solana was going to 30x in a matter of months.

*If only I had known* that March 2020 was the start of a massive bull run, and not a deeper bear market.

And today, *if only I had known* that half a billion dollars of positions were going to be liquidated overnight.

You didn't. You couldn't. People who predicted a crash were right by chance, just like people who predicted a sustained bull run in March were right by chance. There are so many predictions that someone is literally *always* right about *something.*

For veterans, this is just another one of those days. For newbies, I get that it's scary. But there's a reason that you hear people repeat the same things over and over. DCA. HODL. Buy projects you believe in. Never sell the dip. We are all early. Stay away from leverage. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

They're as true during the manic phase of a bull run as they are during a capitulation event like last night.

Don't torture yourself by imagining fantasy scenarios where you bought or sold at the perfect moments, and calculate what you *could* have right now had you only possessed a time machine.

Nothing but misery lies down that path. And yet, if you buy projects you believe in, DCA in, and HODL through the dips and crashes, there will probably be people posting here in 5 years saying ""OMG you're so *lucky* to have bought at X price!!""

But you'll tell them that you didn't feel lucky at the time. You felt like shit, because you played *crypto time machine* and tortured yourself through a two-year bear market. Ask me how I know.

This is likely the last year before this loophole is closed. 

For those unaware, if you sell a stonk for a loss, and buy a similar stonk within 30 days, you are not allowed to claim that capital loss on your tax return. [More here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp). You can add the loss to your cost basis, but the dollar for dollar income deduction goes bye bye forever. 

There is no such limitation on your crypto transactions. If you need to harvest a loss to reduce your tax liability, you can buy right back into the same crypto asset. 

You can offset up to $3,000 in losses per year, and anything else gets carried forward. It‚Äôs a loophole I don‚Äôt expect to last forever, so take advantage while ya can!

t3_r8yo32,So what do we do when we take profit?,"We've just lived yet another Friday night BTC Crash. And the same posts started to pop up in here with similar title: ""something something Take Profit"". 

I do feel this sentiment, and highly support it. 

But we have a dilemma. When we take profit, what do we do with it? Where do we put it?

As we already know, when BTC crashes, it takes everything down with it. It doesn't care about the project, the fundamentals. When BTC is down, we're all down. 

Unless when you take profit you send it to a stable coin, most likely you will put it into another coin/token.  And when BTC goes down, everything goes down. Therefor you profit, in non stable coin, goes down too.

So what do we do when we take profit? Do we completely exit out? 

If we keep on fearing another dip/crash, we will never get back in. DIP/Crash are unpredictable (for most people), but part of the lifecycle of Crypto.

Honestly I think this is part of the Risk/Reward Equilibrium. Some will gain, some will lose. 

And staying in stable coins, for fear of a crash, most likely we will be missing out on some great gains. 

As an example, let's say you sold Solana at $90, you took your profit to stable coins feeling good, smart and happy; then you see SOL is continuing and going towards $300.

So what do we do when we take profit?",CryptoCurrency

We‚Äôve all had our fair share of venturing into ADA SOL AVAX and any other similar coins but ultimately ethereum is here to stay, sure you may find an experience with other platforms better easier, cheaper and that‚Äôs probably the case right now with the gas fees being high but one could say that just shows how utilised ethereum is, running at 100% capacity for now (ETH2.0).

You can't print more Bitcoin, and you might have the power to control the movements on the short term, but people will grow stronger overtime, and find that Crypto is hope for society, and that 1 BTC = 1 BTC, and that Fiat it's just a ponzi.

t3_r8xlu9,Solana library bug could have seen attackers stealing $27 million an hour,"  

* A bug impacting major Solana projects, which had been publicly disclosed, sat unnoticed for six months.
* Security researchers estimated that it could have stolen thousands of dollars per second.

 The bug worked as follows. Simply put, for Solana apps there‚Äôs a  mechanism for when you put funds in and take them out. If the protocol  followed the SPL reference documents, then they would round funds to the  nearest whole number at the point of withdrawal. This would only happen  if the user was owed a fraction of the smallest unit of reference,  known as a Lamport (this is similar to a satoshi, the smallest amount of  bitcoin).

Now this worked both ways. Some people would end up with an extra  fraction of their tokens. Other people would end up with slightly less  than they were owed. But it would be a minuscule amount per person, and  on average would roughly equal out.

But were someone to game the system, the researchers wondered, surely  they could end up taking the tiny extra amounts? And were they to do  this over and over again, perhaps they could make significant amounts of  money.

 The researchers estimated they could execute this bug 150-200 times in a  single transaction and put many of these transactions in a single  block. They figured such an exploit could steal funds at a rate of  $7,500 per second, or $27 million an hour. 

 The researchers swiftly contacted multiple Solana projects that they  believed were affected by this bug. Since many Solana projects are [closed-source](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/125753/solana-projects-closed-source),  it was a much harder task and they wrongly identified a couple of  projects. But they managed to get in contact with Solend, Tulip and  Larix, which all fixed the bug.

Since the bug was disclosed, Solana Labs has also fixed the reference  documents to make sure that new projects following its instructions  won‚Äôt introduce it again.

TL;DR: get your formal methods and verification ready if you want to play with big boys!

t3_r8z7fy,The average crypto developer earns $165k a year salary.,"One of the biggest problems in crypto is that projects don't have enough Devs to get upgrades done in a timely manner, this is an issue that almost every project goes through at one time or another and there's a good chance the projects you are invested in are hiring.

If you have a background in programming and you think that crypto is the future and want to be a part of that, what are you waiting for? I don't know any coding languages myself but others have said that rust and solidity tend to have the smallest learning curve and are the easiest to learn.

Its also not to late to start learning if like me you don't know anything about writing code, you can start with python and c++ and learn solidity and rust from there all inside of 18 months if you put your mind to it.

The majority of projects will be looking for people with experience but if you can bring something to the table I'm sure you would be given an opportunity to atleast write code part time.

Most patterns and indicators are based on how people are behaving and how people behave during certain conditions. It's not a given that that WILL happen. No one can account for a COVID variant messing up markets, or anxiousness about new regulations or taxes.   


If you actually read about any TA of stock movement then you'll realize that most TAs suggest that it's possible that market will move a certain way, no TA can ever predict what will exactly happen. And even if the most accurate and reliable patterns emerge that have proven to be 80% accurate, it just means that there's still 20% chance of the prediction not working out. 

And even then, if PlanB's 98k prediction has proven to be wrong for nov end, it doesn't mean that it cant happen in this cycle. Maybe it'll happen by next week's end , or in next 15 days, or it'll never happen and whole of crypto will crash down to zero amidst global crackdown.   


Predictions and charting are about probabilities, it's about human behavioral patterns based on history of trading and can go either ways. It's not a sci-fi script  by a hollywood writer that will pan out word by word.   


If you want to understand what TAs and other indicators mean and how they pan out or not then go take a beginners course in trading, I am by no means an expert but knowing about basics of it all certainly helps in understanding what's exactly going on. It's def. better than calling everyone out there doing TAs and predictions as idiots and scammers.

t3_r9196z,I'm working on an online RPG with its economy tied to crypto.," I've been knocking this idea around in my head for months so I finally started designing it to figure out how this would actually work. I have another game project on the go which I plan to sell for meme coins with a burn percentage (mainly for Dogelon) however this new project is completely different.

This would be a crypto infused game that you would be playing to play the game, not simply to earn crypto currency. The world economy would have a wallet for a meme coin (think Dogelon, Polydoge, Babydoge) with in-game currency tied directly to it, similar to a wow system of copper to silver to gold, where 10k in the smallest in-game currency would equal 1 meme coin.

You'd be able to buy in for a % fee and withdraw for a % fee, these fees alone should be able to keep the game economy alive. Maybe there could be a subscription service however I don't want to sell things that break the game for free users.

So this is the initial idea of the core mechanic behind this games economy and I thought I would run it by everyone in this community to gather thoughts and ideas. Maybe there is something I can do better? There are a lot of trash crypto currency games out there that are there to take your money and act as glorified savings accounts with shitty rates. I want my game to stand out, and the crypto to simply be a realistic bonus that is tied to the game.

What do you guys think? You guys got any ideas to add to this? How could it be made better? Is there an idea for a subscription service that wouldn't break the game for free players?",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8zt6h,We always hear statements like ‚Äútake profits‚Äù But how? Here are some basic strategies for taking profits and learning what that means,"It‚Äôs all about strategy. Come up with a game plan an execute. One strategy called an ‚ÄúInfinite Return‚Äù has you invest X amount of dollars and when you get to the point of 50%-100% increase, you sell your original investment and keep the profit invested in that coin. Now you have your original investment money back to invest again into a new project and the house‚Äôs money to play with in this new coin. Any money made off of the house‚Äôs money is an ‚ÄúInfinite Return‚Äù. Free money. Alternate Strategy is to sell everything and pool all the money together for the next investment. Example, you start with $200. You get to the 50% gain and you sell. Now you have $300 for the next investment. Rinse and repeat. Oversimplified but that‚Äôs the gist of it.

Everyone here is learning about the power of ‚ÄúDCAing.‚Äù If you get stuck in a losing position, learn to DCA while the price pulls back and look for an exit on a push up. The key is to pick good projects you don‚Äôt mind getting ‚Äústuck into‚Äù. If you are picking riskier projects, it gets harder to sleep at night on down days. 

Another classic strategy is the ‚ÄúBuy and Hold‚Äù. You buy it and forget about it. Work your 5,10,20 year plan. Remember 80% day traders lose money. Much easier to hold for the long term and pick an exit. 

Personally, 90% of my portfolio is holding long term for the last 5 years and just adding to my positions when I can. But recently, the last year or two, 10% of my portfolio is now used for swing trading. Keeping some stable coins for days like this and not using them all at once. Always save some ammunition for an even bigger dip or pullback.

There are lots of different strategies. Learn some, come up with a game plan, and execute. Work the plan.

\- sell limit orders that were triggered automatically, cascading into effect once Bitcoin fell a certain threshold, further domino effect with the others

t3_r8sjte,"This ""crash"" is exactly why you shouldn't talk about crypto during Christmas dinner","We've seen similar posts about this before Thanksgiving, but this crash/dip, whatever you wanna call it (personally I've been calling it Greg) is exactly why you should NOT be talking about crypto during Christmas dinner with your family, S.O. or coworkers. Maybe with your dog or your cat.

What I'm trying to say is that Thanksgiving was last week and I'm pretty sure crypto somehow managed to be a topic in some of your dinners. Maybe an uncle wanted to know more about BTC, a cousin was flexing about his DOGE gains or whatever. And seeing all this red, I can't help but wonder how people who decided to get into crypto after hearing about it or the first time last week time are feeling right now - and if that's your case, just HODL. I think that no matter how cool and entertaining crypto can be, we should be very careful when it comes to recommending investing in it - or investing in anything, really.  
The reality is if tell someone to invest and they make huge gains, they'll make it about themselves. How they managed to pick a great coin, blahblahblah. But if somehow they fail - have you seen the markets these past 10-12h? trust me, that's probably the case - they will somehow blame you. So basically if it goes right, you don't get credit.

If you have no money to add but belive in crpyto then this is a good time to research projects and maybe get to learn some basic technical analysis.

Make sure to prepare your plan. When will you take profits , how will you go about when certain targets a are reached. Hodling is nice but imo hodling 100 percent of your portfolio is not ideal.

For example i hodl only 3 projects and the rest i have to sell and profit from after which i will put the gains in to stablecoins and earn returns on them.

t3_r84lqx,How I used the blockchain against scammers who scammed me and got them to double my funds free of charge,"Quick TL:DR of what happened in my [previous post](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/r4ebvs/how_i_got_scammed_and_how_you_can_avoid_ending_up/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

  Basically, I got a phishing DM on discord and clicked on the link, thinking that a project I was following was finally live and allowed me to mint. I thought all of my money was lost, and hit a dead end everywhere I looked, but luckily all hope wasn‚Äôt lost, and I was able to miraculously recover my funds + basically doubled what I had while causing the scammers to waste thousands of dollars on gas

Now for the meat and the potatoes of what happened as soon as I got scammed. I immediately freaked out and tried to do whatever I can to uncover the identity of these scammers. The phishing website they created (now deleted) was https://fox-game.art/ and i did a Whois lookup, but the scammers had covered their tracks pretty well [as seen here](https://imgur.com/a/zIh0eZm). They‚Äôd used namecheap (which basically hides their true email, IP, address, phone number, etc) so the details of the website couldn‚Äôt be traced back to them.

Now I decided lemme check out the blockhain and see previous transactions that they did, [from their address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d8d12f3f242ef6c409b2fec7ebb0dcdfcfa348a), and I found out they had sent their funds over to a [proxy address](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f692afe5e4e81509506ecca24445e5393cacee6f9a9502d4f5d65521ee0b5aa) before [cashing out via fixedfloat](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf37593fb40eaf81e8c1d7630ca64e3e7e3f4f6dcaed923077863c1eec3956039)

Armed with this info I fired off an email o fixedfloat, and to the privacy email address which was connected to their email (think of it like a string of characters that each individual using namecheap has, but until they reply, their real email isn‚Äôt exposed), and hoped that something happened. As a matter of fact, something did happen. Fixedfloat reached out to me and announced they blacklisted their wallet, and they‚Äôd freeze their funds the next time they made a transaction, and the scammers, freaked out by the threatening email I sent tried to cash out 0.067 eth, or the amount the scammed from me via fixedfloat as a test to see if my threat had any sustenance.

And it did! Fixedfloat froze the 0.067 eth they sent, and the scammers freaking out emailed me( don‚Äôt know if I can share em here because of doxxing stuff) but they immediately refunded the eth they stole from me, and started begging me to tell fixed float that I had made a mistake with my report, so I decided to play their game, and wasted their time by telling them that the only way I‚Äôd help em out is if they sent 1 ETH to the burn address, but sadly they were cheap stakes and realized that the situation had reached a point of no return, and basically moved their funds out via tornado cash

Fixedfloat said they‚Äôd refund me if they got an email from a law enforcement agency and pass on the scammers info, or if 3 months passed, and they didn‚Äôt hear anything back from them (I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt have anything to say since the scammers spent 0.15 ETH a moving money into tornadocash)

Either way, I was super lucky that the scammers took my bait and responded to my email I sent, and they revealed their email, as well as refunded me, but there are a couple of things you can do if your in a similar situation, and ended up getting scammed, even though prevention and being smart is the best way to avoid the headache in the first place.

 1. Do a Whois lookup, and try to find the scammers email or other identifying information and reach out to them, and notify them that your going to report them to law enforcement unless they refund you

 2. Check out their wallet, because they have to convert their crypto to fiat at one point, and often use a swap service or centralized exchange, to whom you can reach out to 

 3. File a police report and contact other law enforcement entities because most exchanges will use that to release their funds back to you, if they seize em, or forward their information to law enforcement agencies so they can pursue charges

Edit : Really appreciate the attention that this post has gotten, but I‚Äôm NOT advocating for you to willingly send scammers money to try to get more back, it WILL NOT work unless the scammers are extremely stupid, and you‚Äôll end up losing it, or spending a long ass time recovering it",CryptoCurrency

Fast forward 3 months and we‚Äôre both down 50%. My roommate sold and it scared me to sell as well. I thought to myself, this is going nowhere.

t3_r8tn6h,Fed December 15th Meeting Can Trigger The Depression... Trade Accordingly,"Powell hinted this week that an acceleration of tapering is possible due to inflation. The Fed is in a quiet period until their meeting on December 15th. On this day a press release will be released to indicate if an acceleration of tapering will happen. 

If the December 15th press release indicates accelerated tapering will occur, you will immediately see red in the market, and unfortunately the deleveraging process will accelerate and pop the market. We are in the end of a long term debt cycle (~100 year cycle) for the macro environment and anyone following this knows it's just a matter of time. 

If the December 15th meeting states tapering will not be accelerated, then the markets live on a bit longer.

However, Powell was recently renominated and no longer owes any allegiance to Biden. He went against Biden this week during a hearing and hinted at accelerated tapering. Powell was nominated first by Trump. The Republicans do not want more inflation. And now that Powell knows his renomination is behind him, I think he will indeed taper on the 15th. This will trigger the end of easy money until they reverse course and print the next more massive round of stimulus. 

It's in the interest of Republicans to make the economy look bad around now, which is perfect timing for critical mid-term campaigns for US Congressmen. 

Why is this the straw that breaks the camel's back? (1) Markets will immediately price in higher probabilities of interest rates increases in 2022+ due to risk of hyper inflation. This will have a cascading effect on the market that is over leveraged from excessive access to easy money. (2) Real productivity in the world is down due to the pandemic. These two key factors combined are enough to trigger the unwinding of leverage in the system. The end of more money... chasing less productivity... is a recipe for disaster... as it necessitates a correction. 

I would short crypto on the 15th if accelerated tapering is announced. Don't hesitate just sell on such news. The bottom will reverse once the government gets ready for its next bigger round of stimulus. Prepare your mind for volatility, be patient, trade well, good luck everyone.

t3_r8vata,"TA is only good as the data we got, possible evidence of manipulation, and a look at a few things that could happen","First thing is first, lets get into the manipulation bit because that interest me a bit more. As I mention in my past post here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r87uyu/interesting\_events\_i\_noticed/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r87uyu/interesting_events_i_noticed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

the other night a number of banking people and investment firms was telling me to set stop losses before yesterday. I made a post about it, and some people were indicating some comments like a clock is right twice a day while ignoring this info was coming from the elite. I ended up commenting on that reply saying what I was worried about is it's more of an internal thing and how they know the news before we know it type of thing. It ended up getting downvoted to hell, I figured the problem passed and maybe the warning was the UBS Bank news mix with the new virus news, so I deleted it and figure maybe they were right. I wish I didn't delete it, but still. With what happened today it gets me wondering a bit more about this.

In that post I mentioned these are people I share TA but they aren't my friends. Let me expand on that a bit more. I'm high functioning autistic. That alone causes many elite companies and to be honest practically any company that isn't low level fast food to not want me. And this is even with me having 4 degrees and tons of certs. And what makes it worse, I pretty much have to work fully remote because driving starts becoming a problem and moving means completely leaving what little support network I have. I've seen NO company open to hiring an autistic person fully remote unless if they have several decades of experience and this is even with how the virus stuff going. Like in general autistic people with a degree have about an 85% unemployment rate.

Now with that being said, being it's my upbringing, me being autistic, or something else. It is extremely easy for me to start seeing patterns in things and think way outside of the box. This means if I have enough data, TA is easy for me. But because it's easier in a group, and because people in banking and investment firms can have a hard time with this. I bounce stuff off them. I get a confirmation on if I'm on the right track and if they see what I'm seeing, and they get to have an easier time in their job and keep their job. It's a win win on that. Now, they aren't my friends because these same people will stab anyone in the back and they 100% know about my situation but do not lift a finger to help. And the conversation starts and ends with how they can be helped.

So again, I wonder as I mention in my prior post.

1. The thing where if 2 people hold a secret sooner or later it will get out, and basically people knew you know what is about to hit the fan and they wanted to do the right thing at the risk of their job. (That or they know if I lose my motivation and care in this, then I stop helping them since I don't even get paid by them. I only get a confirmation if they see the same thing I am.)
2. This is a campaign to manipulate the market. Basically get retail investors to sell so it drive a massive dip so elite can buy it up to make the EOY profits sky high as the prices will rise later this year (or at least past projections and current projections still say).
3. Or maybe I'm reading too much into this.

# TA and data

Anyways, lets get into TA in general. TA is only as good as the data we have. As mentioned before, there is some likely this is manipulated. But even if it isn't, TA is the difference between going in completely blind or going in with some things you know and working with that.

Basically, TA for me for it to be useful it needs to have an 80% accuracy rating. Which means 20% of the time it still can run into problems like we did last night.

As far as I can tell, almost no one in TA seen this coming. This is both a good and bad thing. If the market really is manipulated to this degree, then it's good because it means we didn't miss anything and short of being a part of the manipulation we wouldn't had the data anyways. Bad if it wasn't being manipulated because that means we most likely missed something.

There is another possibility btw. This is just my personal side theory. But China is doing a crack down on their citizens investing in crypto and foreign stuff. Like they are trying to bring back the money because China is about to go bankrupt in a number of years or decades if they don't fix the problem now. Anyways, my side theory is this could be a lot of China money leaving both the normal market and crypto.

1. We are in another Wyckoff situation (consolidation). The chart above shows what happened last time and what would it look like this time. It's pretty much the exact same price range, and we will be looking at May maybe if it plays out a 1:1 which I doubt even if this one happens. There isn't enough data yet on this to prove or disprove this one. So even if it is true, there isn't enough data to give good timeframes.
2. We might bounce back up. I doubt this.
3. We are now in a bear market. The likely if this is true we could see the price go down to $10k-$15k range. This is the worse case. I think it is way too soon to say for sure on this one. And to be honest, I think this is the least likely.

I think the most likely is 1. There is some likely the price won't go down as much as it did last time. Call it what you want, but it's likely to consolidate for a few months. The good news is this is the case, this means when it does go up in a few months. We could be looking at $300k at the peak or higher. But again, we don't have enough data on that to confirm it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I will get some will point out I just basically said the price will go up down. But these are people who most likely will lose at the end of the day because they miss the forest from the trees type of thing. The point of this is we are talking about massive massive massive swings. You need to seriously think about each situation and what you would do if x y or z happens.

For example, if it drops below $38k then it is likely to keep going until $30k-$28k. If it breaks through that then it could be a true bear market. If it shoots back up then it's likely we will go to $90k or $100k and then the bull market will be done after it's peak. If we consolidate and do sideways action for a few months, it's likely we will see this at it's peak to get close to $300k and in some situations higher.

In all situations year over year however. If you hold if it does go in a bear market it is likely you might go down in value a good while. If it jumps or consolidates. It is likely your value will increase next year this time. So there is a lot to think about.

If people are interesting in it. As we get more data, I will make updates in the future.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8qii1,Some advise about Crypto and what people can actually do right now..,"I have been in crypto for years (2012) since I bought in the earlier stages and also I have been in the stock market for a long time (1988). Every Bull and Bear market bring new lessons on what could or should have been done into your own investments. It's what makes us a better investor in the long haul and if you keep the strategies now you will do really well in the future.

1 This board and other places are really harping on it and it's the greatest thing I have ever seen. DCA in and slim down positions when up heavy. When the bear strikes and it will for both crypto and the stock market set aside money every month and split it out between good companies and or crypto. 

2 Spread out your investments and cover a wide range like ETH, BTC pick (don't want to shill) 3-4 more and dca every month. Same with stocks pick good stocks that will be around forever ie Google, Visa, United Healthcare on and on (don't want to shill stocks either). Take some profit when they are up 30-40 percent and let the rest ride. This will kill the FOMO and FUD and make you a better investor.

3 There is actually something you can do to help crypto here and yourself. I know this has been said forever in these forums, but here we go again. NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COIN. Pull your coins from the exchanges. First if a big exchange ever gets hacked you could be in trouble. Next by pulling them  you are taking away ammo from these giant whales that use YOUR bitcoin to move the prices. Defi is also lending out, and the only one I do not stake is bitcoin. How Bitcoin goes the market will follow. so even pull your BTC instead of getting that low 4%. 

4 We are actually do for a crash in both the stock market and crypto. Instead of worrying about it make it a fucking golden opportunity. If you are in your 20's you will probably experience 7-10 crashes in your time. This is your time to shine and instead of fretting it's time to plow in. There will be times you will regret your decisions during a long bear market , but as long as what you bought and you believe in you will do well. 

5 I have seen a lot of people talk about the dot com bubble and I was in it full tilt. What people really don't understand is the magnitude of the hit at the start. The NAZ went from 5000 to 3250 in very short time. It trapped a lot of people at the top, and instead of investing wisely they turned to what I call prayer investing, and don't look at your account ever. I know the stock market and crypto are not the same, but the lesson is still there. Buy good companies, crypto or whatever over time and it will pay off down the road. 

6 The canary in the coal mine. Again this is a stock but the same pattern hold true for crypto. I took a hard look at DOCU or DocuSign yesterday. It was down 42% and there was absolute no strength  or even a semblance of any rally. Investors are dumping growth and speculative plays and you can see it. Those DocuSign investors are going to be underwater for the next 10 years. If something like that happens to your investment can you hold out for that long. If the answer is no I think it's time you take a little off the table, because bear markets get really bad and fast so DON""T INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8xnjk,This dip / crash is why taking profits is always a good idea.,"Crypto is extremely volatile. 

Always have a target. When it hits the target, sell a portion. Set multiple targets! Also set multiple targets for buying the dips. 

Imagine when BTC was at $45k 3 months ago, you set targets to sell at $55k, a higher portion at $65k. An even higher portion to sell at $75k etc.

And made buying targets at small portion at $38k, $30k etc.

This works only if you set targets at different prices for eg. When BTC is at $60k you set buying targets at $50k. 

You would‚Äôve made a good profit and still had a good amount of BTC. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have had as much profit as if you would‚Äôve sold at an ath but it‚Äôs still profit regardless and we all know it‚Äôs impossible to time the market.

t3_r8w7z2,Let's appreciate how strong Ethereum is holding up,"While Bitcoin has gone down with 12% this week, Ethereum only went down 2% this week and is still above 4K. It looks like 4K is a strong support, and apart from maybe a wick, I don't think Ethereum is going to go much lower.

If I had to pick between buying Bitcoin here or buying Ethereum here, I would definitely go with Ethereum.

And also, while this may trigger Bitcoin maxi's, I don't agree with the idea that most of your portfolio ""needs"" to be in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may be the safest bet, it'll probably also give the lowest return from here. 

If you don't like taking big risks or you want to hold for 10 years, then Bitcoin is the best option. Or if you're a multi-billionaire and you want to be sure to have liquidity.

But if you're a trader, if you don't think we're in a bear market yet, and if you're not a billionaire, I would pick Ethereum over Bitcoin anyday.

t3_r8xaxp,How crypto can break free from the stock market,"Despite becoming it's own mini economy, when people become fearful, the price action in crypto seems to perfectly match the American stock market. 

On some level, it makes sense. During a market correction people become more risk adverse and review all their holdings with fear. Bitcoin etfs get sold off en mass (they almost always trade bellow fair value) and newcomers jump ship.

This is the unfortunate reality of being largly tethered to US currency.

But it doesn't always have to be this way.

As bitcoin and other major cryptos continue to gain legitimacy, the price action could start to stabilize independently of the larger markets (or perhaps move inversely like gold).


I belive that if the crypto market can transition into a pattern of steady growth instead of kangaroo jumps, major coins will be seen as safe havens in times of economic uncertainty. And the good news is, every year coins hold their value (and btc is up huge this year) works to increase investor confidence.

Even though we all woke up to a crash that saw our potential profits plummet to a new low, in an extremely volatile crypto market that is to be expected.

What isn't to be expected, is to wake up to a community of millions of crypto enthusiasts who support each other through times like these with a certain comedic flair.

""**Why Is Community Important To Mental Health?**

We‚Äôre social beings, and we are not meant to live in isolation. Community is critical for us to thrive, especially for someone with mental illness who is already experiencing the common symptoms of loneliness and isolation.¬†Community provides many elements that are critical to mental health, but here are three of the most beneficial aspects.

**Belonging**  
If you‚Äôve ever felt like you don‚Äôt fit in, you know it can be a lonely experience. Community provides a sense of belonging ‚Äî a group you identify as being a part of. This is different than conforming to be in a group. A true sense of belonging includes the ability for you to feel you are a part of the community as your true self. There is not anything you have to change to be a part of the community, but instead, you are embraced and appreciated for your unique qualities.

**Support**  
Who do you turn to when you need something? Having people you can call on when you need to talk or need help with something can help you through difficult situations that might feel insurmountable alone. Knowing there are people who support you¬†¬†can help you feel cared for and safe, and can benefit your outlook on life.

**Purpose**  
In community, people fill different roles. Perhaps you‚Äôre the friend who enjoys cooking and can be counted on to bring a hot meal over when someone is going through something. Or you‚Äôre the friend who others know they can call when they need to talk about their struggles. These roles can give you a sense of purpose through bettering other people‚Äôs lives. Having purpose, and helping others, helps give meaning to life.""

t3_r8h475,"Don't Panic. I repeat, DON'T PANIC.","I don't believe market pundits. I don't believe crypto vloggers. I don't believe almost anyone. I believe in Douglas Adams and the two most important words he wrote. *Don't panic.* And I'm going to tell you why. This isn't hopium. It's calm-the-fuck-down-ium. 

As long as we can agree on this one basic thing, I think we'll agree on the rest. *Cryptocurrencies have proven to be a long-term sustainable marketplace.* I say this not only because of it's decade plus long ability to grow, but also because of it's now moving into government and large-scale business trades. There are going to be countless prop-ups and setbacks, as every market has.

Every market. Stocks are only one. Real estate, commodity trades, lending, antique/etc., every kind of market sees growth, setbacks, periods of uncertainty, periods of near-collapse, etc. Crypto isn't any different - and that's important. Because your opinions of macro-scale events in crypto will most likely be tempered by your outlook on investing in general.

The most obvious comparison is to the stock markets. Every one throughout time has been different, but the NYSE is a good example of how major events and differing periods have changed over time. And the cool thing is, we've got a good 200+ years of data to use. And on a *macro* scale - that's fucking enormous!

I totally stole this image. But it's a great representation of markets within the NYSE over it's entire existence. The one single thing that it has *always* done, is grow. It's got no reason not to. 

[https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/200-years-u-s-stock-market-sectors\/](https://preview.redd.it/ilm7v0b7xf381.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=868dded393441c3ae1d1bc0cf786bd80666e3900)

Major events are pretty visible, the Civil War, the Depression, the dot/com boom, etc. (Check out the real estate pinch in '08). Point being - it's *always* changing. And this is just the markets *within the market as a whole.*

We don't have the best data for the 1800s. It exists, but I'm not going to pay for the good datasets. So I'm going to pick it up at the 1900s with the DJI. 

[https:\/\/stockcharts.com\/freecharts\/historical\/marketindexes.html](https://preview.redd.it/7vo6gr8tyf381.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ce70d77714ea3f2774026b33d2bf06cc265df5)

Again, you can see all the major events pretty clearly. When you zoom out, the Depression was a correction. The 40's were slow recovery. The 50's were back on pace. The 60s were a boom. The 70s were a correction. The 80s and 90s were to the moon. And then the game changed entirely. And that's where we come in.

Since the early 2000s, market movements haven't been in decades (as seen above). They've been in years. And even *more* recently, they've been in months. There are a million reasons why, and I'm not here to argue about those - that's not for crypto. Crypto is just feeling the ripples of these movements. But knowing the context helps put crypto movements in a much better perspective.

The stock markets aren't flinging around pocket change anymore. We're on a fucking rocket. And we have been, since 2009. Everything took off in 90s. 1995 to be specific. And that bull trend didn't break, even with the war starting in the early 2000s, until midway through the '07-09 recession. Then, you can argue it however you want. Overcorrection? Probably, but we took the fuck off. And the only thing so far that has really stopped us hard has been the beginning of the pandemic. Recovery throughout the pandemic, at least in the markets, has been insane. In the last ten years, the beginning of Covid-19 is the *only* major market setback, and we already recovered. The recovery is the issue.

And now we find ourselves here.

These last two years have been crazy, right? Insane bull runs. Huge recovery. Didn't break trend until June '21. And now we've found ourselves (stock market-wise) in a consolidation period with some pretty strong support at 34000. 

Now, if you ask me - and I know you didn't, the growth over 2019 was far more sustainable. We shoved *everything* at pandemic recovery and FUD. And we rebounded insanely fast. Like, too fast. You can argue the recovery from 2008 took too long at 5+ years, but you can't argue it didn't maintain it's growth. And then, IMO, the previous administration decided to play casino and the markets ran with it. And then, within a couple of years, it all caught back up with itself into some mild correction. And then the pandemic. And you can see the crazy fast recovery has tapered and left us kind of sitting around 35,000. 

So, why the fuck does all this matter? 

BECAUSE CRYPTO IS BRAND FUCKING NEW. You've spent a decade in crypto? Sweet, me too. You know what that means? Absolutely nothing. Because go take a look at the first chart again of market sectors.

It's blockchain. It's far bigger than just BTC, even though we'll use BTC as a metric for decades to come still.

The stock markets grew from finance, to mainstay transportation, energy, and a host of other major submarket sectors. Crypto has been doing the same, at an accelerated pace. From simple finance, to logistics, to defi, to web3, to now meta, and who the fuck knows what's next. Markets will never fail as long as one thing remains true - it's profitable. And they are.

This is what happens when crypto goes from being Bitcoin to being an entire market capable of sustaining multiple projects, multiple directions, and un-ending potential. You almost don't even need to change the titles on the first chart to believe it's what's happening to crypto. Diversification.

Here's my last chart, I swear. And it will hopefully put crypto into perspective. What has happened in the last two years. It's not 2013. It's not 2018. It's almost not even 2021 anymore. 

I left time boxes on because it's pretty much the only way to identify the stock market exists.

t3_r8rswi,I now understand a little better what these crashes are all about...margin calls and short liquidations.,"I know someone that got lquidated last night cause he thought a coin had hit the bottom and bought with margins. But the price kept on dropping and he lost it all.   That is the game, the market lures as much peope/money in as possible with gains and euphoria for weeks and months.  Fatten all the fish(that's us) up with margins, loans, and all, making most of us believe or forget that the price would ever go down to previous lows again.   And then when all the fish are stuffed as fuck as possible, the whales and sharks drops their nets, some get caught right away on the first swoop, and some a little further down cause they thought it was safe not believing or forgetting how far and deep the nets can go.  And the nets keep dropping down for more sweeps, catching the unexpecting fish. Then it's rinse and repeat.  It's the hodlers that bring up the value of the coins year to year.  It's the traders using margins and short callers that cause these massive drops.   Then it's rinse and repeat.  As more hodlers increase, the whales just play with higher prices, which hardly matters at all, it's all about percentages.

It kind of reminds me of this like a game I use to play often at Chuck E Cheeses - I forget the name but it was just a thin plastic ball in a tube suspended by blowing air that the player controls.  You make it go up in the tube  by giving it more air and lower the ball by reducing the air. The limitation was with how quick you can move the ball, it falls at the speed of gravity and goes up with the limited air pressure.    The idea was to keep the ball between a moving range. If you get out of range you lose.  So the player was to anticipate the move of the range with limited controls.   It starts off easy, but as the player succeeds further and further in time, the range begins to move faster and more erratic until it catches you.   I loved that game cause I was able to make it to the end more often than most people.  That game reminds me of the game traders play here.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8g2w1,Ethereum: A Deep Dive. Here's why Ethereum is the opportunity of a lifetime.,"# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is the largest smart contract blockchain in the world, and it's native coin ether (ETH) is the second most valuable cryptocurrency. As a smart contract chain, it essentially operates as a decentralized computer. You can run all kinds of decentralized and trustless applications on this computer like DEX's (Decentralized Exchanges) for example. It's also very popular with NFT's. Every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain takes up a resource called gas. There is a limited amount of data that can go in each block, therefore there is a limited amount of gas. The price of gas (and therefore, transactions) is dictated by the laws of supply and demand; if more people want to make transactions then the price of transactions will increase.

# I've heard it's expensive as fuck! What's being done?

This is probably Ethereum's largest criticism. It's no secret that the Ethereum blockchain is very expensive to use. It's important to recall that the only reason the blockchain is so expensive is because it's in such high demand.

This problem is being mitigated in a few ways:

1. Layer 2 solutions. These are other blockchains that are built on top of Ethereum that utilize it's security and decentralization. [They have fees that are much cheaper than the native blockchain.](https://l2fees.info/) But surprisingly, they're still not that cheap. Again - really high demand. The largest issue with Layer 2 solutions comes from the fact that they aren't widely accepted yet. Most exchanges don't support them natively, which means you would need to use an expensive bridge to move your funds over if you don't already use an exchange that supports them. The other issue with them is that there are many different L2's, and different dAPPS support different chains.
2. ETH2. This upgrade is frankly legendary. It's made up of a few different pieces. The first one is Ethereum's merge to Proof of Stake. I'll discuss it in more detail later. The more important piece for scaling is Sharding. Sharding allows us to seperate the blockchain into more managable pieces. This means that each node will only need to store a piece of the blockchain instead of the entire thing. This increases both speed and decentralization, it's an absolute no brainer.

# What makes Ethereum different then all the other chains?

Ethereum is extremely popular. This is one of the biggest benefits that Ethereum has over other blockchains. [On DefiPulse,](https://defipulse.com/) every single one of the top 128 DeFi projects run on Ethereum. **Every Single One.** It is by far the most popular and the most successful blockchain. It also consistently racks up much higher transaction volumes and network fees collected than even the big daddy Bitcoin.

# What's the merge to Proof of Stake all about?

Ethereum will merge from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This is currently estimated to occur in Q2 2022, but that may change. This change will:

1. Reduce Ethereum's energy usage by more than 99%. Since instead of mining, block proposers have to stake ETH, Ethereum's energy usage will fall by a huge amount. This is great because crypto projects are constantly targeted for their energy usage. Ethereum will be immune to this criticism.
2. Make block proposers accountable. In the current PoW system, if a miner attacks the blockchain they cannot be punished. Under PoS, they have staked their ETH into the network, which means it can be slashed if they misbehave. This improves security, as no sane person would attack a network that they have thousands of dollars staked in.
3. Allows for sharding. Sharding isn't currently possible on Proof of Work chains. Proof of Stake allows for this important upgrade.

# Okay, so Ethereum is great. But will it make me money?

Hell yes. The merge to PoS is probably the most bullish event in the entirety of crypto, in my opinion. Here is why. You may remember the EIP-1559 upgrade a few months ago that reduced the amount of ETH being issued by about 30%. Here's ETH's price leading up to this event:

[60&amp;#37; increase in 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/pn3ak1ycyf381.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc12b7c0c9305406a65ecb55d9322bcada7e8377)

You will notice a 60% increase in price in 2 weeks. Fucking wild.

This what happened when the ETH creation rate was reduced by 30%. Now brave yourself for this: **the merge to PoS will reduce emissions by 90%.** You can infer yourself how bullish you think this is, but I have no doubt it will be bullish as all fuck. If a 30% decrease in ETH creation is bullish enough for a 60% increase, a 90% decrease is going to be absolutely wild. The laws of supply and demand dictate that if supply decreases-as it will, because ETH will become deflationary-and demand remains constant, price MUST increase. This is a perfect storm of events for an absolute explosion in ETH's price.

# TL;DR

**Ethereum is the most popular smart contract blockchain by a mile. Its issues are being actively worked on by thousands of people all over the world who are very dedicated. Its merge to PoS is going to be one of the most bullish events ever. If a 30% decrease in ETH issuance causes a 60% increase in price, what do you think a 90% decrease in ETH issuance will cause? Ethereum has an amazing future, and so will you if you invest in it.**",CryptoCurrency

That'd be awesome if Crypto was full of no fear and uncertainty. But I've stuck around long enough now to see this repeated process of huge crashes and the retail investors running scared.

This is the worst December on record thus far; but there's still time to recover. Also, Alts are holding up really well. Luna is at $60, still close to its previous ATH.

I think we're going to see BTC recover, it's a question of when and not if. But it cracks me up, if you are in this for the long run you have nothing to worry about. It's amazing that Bitcoin crashed to 46k. The day I see 12k again is when I really will have something to write about here on the subreddit.",CryptoCurrency

1. If your coins are stored on the blockchain, what does it matter if the centralized exchange you use goes bust?  If a CEX goes bust, can't you just validate the transation history on-chain to retain said ownership?  

2. If coins are stored on-chain, what is the point of hardware wallets besides keeping your seed phrase offline? Are hardware wallets actually ""depositing"" your coins onto exchanges, or are they just connecting them with blockchains under your identifiers to make a transaction? If so, what's actually happening when ""withdrawing"" your coins onto a hardware wallet?  

3. If I lend a sibling a car, I still have the pink slip, so ownership is not transferred. If I lend my coins to a protocol and it goes bust, why can't I get my coins back? Or is lending coins actually a tranferance of ownership of your coins on-chain (under pretense provided by said protocol)? If so are there alternatives where I can lend coins and actually retain ownership to prevent such an event from occurring?

t3_r8rzdr,Question about Brave browser (disappearing BAT),"Okay, moving on to the topic at hand. I've recently noticed that the revenue that appears in the ""BAT rewards"" tab is disappearing. Let's say - on Friday I have the browser open all day, ads pop up etc - I earn let's assume 0,35 BAT for this. I close the browser in the evening, next day I restart the computer and see that I have only 0,2 BAT in this tab.

The same happens on brave beta and nightly. On the company lapotp the same thing happens. Do you also have such situations? For me it is a little strange that after receiving BAT for displayed advertisement the next day it is taken away from me. Same with November payouts (where it says it will start in 4 days) yesterday it wrote that the payout will be much bigger than today.

Additionally, I have noticed that the amount of given BAT for each advertisement has changed - another blow, but I understand it. However, it is also strange that one day I normally get paid for them and the next day, for a few hours, even though the ads are displayed and appear - I do not have these payments.

Am I doing something wrong? Should it be like this, that BAT are taken away from me? How does this even happen?

t3_r8m5ow,this is how the market works,"If you are a newcomer and you are now panicking for this huge correction, i understand, but there are a few things you got to understand when it comes to crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Crypto is an algorithmic driven market. What does it mean? This means that around certain percentage of movements up and down, bots swarm and start buying and selling. Why is this important? Because the main narrative around crypto is about shilling and fud propaganda that aims to give false narrative to justify movements to illiterate wannabe traders and retail investors. The reality is that the market is programmed to have corrections around certain areas, to pump from certain targets, and every time influencers try to spread the narrative that a crash or a pump is due to this or that event, that is true only on very minimal part, and that's because of point 2.
2. Crypto is manipulated. Yes, it is, but not in the way you might understand: First i'll ask you a question that will give you a big insight on what is happening: When you enter a shop, who makes the price of the stuff? those who own the stuff. This is not different in crypto market. Whales are often the exchanges themselves: if you buy, they will do their best to devalue it to buy lower. If you sell, they will do their best to increase the value of what they have. This is all automated and co-ordinated. Add up one thing, the less you have and trade, the more the fees are. Big whales and exchanges can trade at 0 fees. So what does the narrative serve the whales? to justify big co-ordinated movements and scare you out of your coins or convince you to give them your fiat. It's the same for them, so if you trade thinking you can outsmart the market, you lose. You either believe in your coins or you value your fiat more. You have to decide and not let yourself be fooled into continuously changing your plans based on the narrative.
3. back to point 1: so why the social and real world events influence crypto market? Imagine you are nearing an area where the bots are not programmed to buy but to sell. The market will try naturally and automatically their best to go down. What whales do? They might start to buy artificially and pump alts to incentivize people into FOMOING, giving away fiat, which they need to pump important coins after the accumulation ends. Pumping BTC increase the FOMO and crypto adoption, and they make more money with more people buying in.That's why ANY good or bad event (a nation banning crypto, DOW JONES going down, covid, etcetera) is a perfect excuse for whales to let the market do it's course while blaming this or that event and not lose the face to the market. Especially new investors need to believe that the market is ALL natural and not programmed/manipulated, because, if so, whales will be exposed and people will be less gullible and prone to mistakes. and now we get to point 4:
4. Why is this knowledge so important to not be spread? because whales are in it for the profits. If more and more people understand how the market works, there's less and less people being fooled. Why doesn't traders tell you this stuff? because as whales they are in it for the money. The more people understand how the market works, the harder it gets to make money.
5. why do i tell you this stuff? Because i care about the technology more than it's price. I really think that the world finance WILL transition on crypto, and the more people understand how it works, the more the market will be stable and start to resemble the stock market. And this will be good. Once we will get out of the gold mine rush of a market full of people trying to scam each other, crypto WILL become the technology that will revolutionize the world.

So in short, if you want to make money, study how the market works. If you want Crypto to grow up of this phase of maniac and psychopath Scam industry and become the technology that can make the World a more fair and better place, LEARN HOW IT WORKS. Don't panic sell your coins, what goes up must go down, but the market as a whole will go up. But remember that VALUE and PRICE are two different things. The price that people today is willing to pay for a technology, it's not necessairly the value of it, and it's not written anywhere that it is how much it is going to cost in the future. As in the Dot-com bubble, internet was the revolution everyone was expecting, but 99% of the companies listed at first, failed miserably making a lot of people go bankrupt. Don't be gullible, have plans, don't go all in, don't invest more than you are willing to pay, but please, don't throw money at the machine like it is a slot machine, because this is not healthy for you and neither for the technology. Good luck and stay safe out there, stay focused on the big scheme.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8ro8o,This is where fortunes are made (and lost),"It was a little surprising to see the crypto markets when I woke up this morning but we all knew it was coming eventually. This is what we prepare for people. This is why you take profits and hold money on the sidelines. 

I do not think the crash is over and I also don't think the bull run is over. 

Obvious market manipulation right now. Large holdings are liquidated, new/ fearful investors panic and sell, this causes the ""crash"". What's next? In my opinion we will see one or two ""dead cat bounces"" before the last leg of the bull run. A dead cat bounce is when the market turns green after a large dump. This is where the people that want to sell right now but don't want to take such a loss will get all excited that the market is going up again, buy more if they can, and then when the large liquidations happen again, they will panic sell for an even larger dip.

How do I know this? Because it literally happens all the time. Bull runs attract new investors and everyone is high on gains. Whales know this and capitalize on it. For you to profit, someone else had to lose.

If you're the trading type, you can make some quick gains from these dead cat bounces but it's way too hard to predict bottoms and tops in my opinion. Personally, I'm not touching my long term holds and I pulled my yield farming/ trading funds out in anticipation for another 20%-30% crash in the coming month. 

I don't 100% understand all of the tax implications but as the year ends, some might intentionally sell at a loss to show that loss on their books and avoid capital gains. Then buyback in the new year. I may be misunderstanding that but I can still see that concept leading to more negative price movement.

In summation: the fundamentals of your favorite projects have not changed. If your original plan was to hold for ___ years then you're not even worried right now, right? Pick price targets and DCA more into your holdings if you can afford to. As for me, I genuinely think we'll see another 30% drop before year's end and I am planning accordingly.

# Crypto Market Insight: Don‚Äôt fall for FUD  

It‚Äôs a sea of red on the charts but hope remains in the form of strong buying at resistance levels. The Bitcoin bull market trendline has been broken with today‚Äôs candles close at 53k. This event will mark the first close below this important trendline. Price is coming down to test a strong resistance level between 52.5k and 54K indicated on the chart below. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC\/USD 1D](https://preview.redd.it/akw0kwpbmf381.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383787bf4d8fbff0c54a975962df5f1199fedb1a)

There are three possibilities that may occur here. 

1. Over the weekend price may rebound quickly enough to jump back into trend. 

2. Price could begin testing this resistance various times over the next week/s, setting bitcoin in a range. 

3. Prices break below the resistance to go test the next level at 50k. 

Today‚Äôs volume isn‚Äôt indicating a lot of strength which will favor a rebound off the resistance. The pin-bar candle noted on the 4-hour chart is reaffirming the strength of the resistance.

Funding rates are telling us that a cascade of selloffs will not occur due to liquidations in the derivatives. Volatility is increasing with this move and the consolidation we hoped for didn‚Äôt occur today. The down move is due to current macro climate. (Omnicron and FED-tapering news) 

**Stock Market**

Volume continues to be strong in stock market sell-off and yesterday‚Äôs rebound was short-lived. The topic of decoupling from stocks will have to be saved for another day. This market is dragging crypto with it. Stock market funds are moving into bonds out of fear. The VIX (Volatility Index) and fear gauge hit a new high of 35.32. Monday will tell us a lot about if this sell-off will continue in stocks. 

**Wrap-up**

Macroeconomic FUD is brining prices down, which is an emotional rection of the market. The current sentiment can dissipate quickly, and this would turn things around. There is little evidence of a major sell-off in crypto, so it‚Äôs recommended that you keep on hodling, watch the weekend prices and hope FUD dies down on Monday.

# NEWBIES‚Äô lesson of the day

**Controlling the fear during sell offs**

Cryptocurrencies are very volatile in nature and watching your money go down 10% in one day can be a scary event. You must remember that you can‚Äôt have 300% gains in a market without occasional 30-75% drawdowns. The price you pay for those gains is paid in resilience and patience. The last thing you want to do is to panic and sell to the traders that take advantage of fear in the markets. 

You must do your due diligence and research the projects you are putting your money into. If you truly believe in the technology and project, then holding on to losing positions is a lot easier. This is another reason not to invest heavily into meme coins. Read the news and see how much money is being invested into this market daily and see the hundreds of companies and banks maneuvering to get a piece of the pie. Crypto is here to stay. 

Get in the habit of selling when everyone is euphoric, which is incredibly hard. And buying when everyone else is fearful. Use the tools around you to help give you an edge. This is a large-scale game where others are trying to buy your investments at a lower price than you paid for it, don‚Äôt let have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great weekend everyone and remember to stack those sats!

It‚Äôs being advertised by celebrities, made fun of by South Park, and gaining more media spotlight every months. The people who love the tech bros now love crypto. It‚Äôs no longer niche. My mom asked me to help her.           

**Regulation:** They are in the works, and ETF was just approved, others are continuously filing, there is movement and talk and deadlines, GG and the rest of them acknowledge cryptocurrencies as assets and promised to regulate them. With this movement comes progress even if it‚Äôs sideways.       

**Institutions:** Buying and holding BTC has become easier for retail investors, the availability of institutional-level infrastructure has eased their entry and they haven‚Äôt even started to really pour into this space yet. It‚Äôs growing daily, enticing global investors to keep their capital invested in the hardest assets they can find. There is a wall of institutional money waiting for regulations to be put into place so they can dump their cash reserves into this new asset class.           

**Inflation:** inflation is real. Inflation is not transitory. Inflation is probably higher than how they calculate it. This is a global issue for all countries and monetary systems. Bitcoin is the answer the the problem of inflation. You must store your wealth, your value, your energy, your time, your savings, in something that outpaces and exceeds the debasement of fiat money.         

**Sovereignty:** Cryptos now can challenge the primacy of the state and its monopoly on creating, printing and control of legal tender.         

**Anarchism:** In a sense, ‚Äúbitcoin is the spearhead of a particularly extreme form of libertarian anarchism‚Äù where cryptographically protected anonymization technologies, digital pseudonyms, and digital money are used to circumvent state control - surveillance, censorship, and taxation.

If you look at Bitcoin charts history you can clearly see this bull market is not even similar to the ones before. For example this is the first bull market where we broke ATH 2 times. In bull markets before we just touched ATH and then went straight down.

In this bull market Bitcoin touched an ATH in april and then crashed in May. We had a boring summer where bitcoin touched the bottom of 29k. And even after all of that we managed to break ATH from april and we hit 69k.

I've been following this project for a few weeks and I thought r/CryptoCurrency might like to check it out.

Nexus is an Algorand Standard Asset that is service based towards players of online video games like MMORPG's and CS:GO. It's a zero fee service that allows these players to advertise if they want to swap in-game currency from one game to another. Their project lead is also super transparent about pretty much everything. u/gregorymyllama

Like, if I got bored of playing World of Warcraft, I could use nexus to swap my currency over to Guild Wars 2. Or sell it to another player.

I like the idea of the project, because it helps to combat bots in the games. If nobody is buying the gold off the shady websites, that will lead to no bots in that game.

**Benefits of using Nexus:**

* No risk of getting banned from the game
* No entering credit card information into sketchy RMT websites
* Player to player exchange
* Insurance for the trades (ain't nobody going to scam)

NEXUS was just verified by the Algo Explorer team today. If you guys want to check them out, you can visit their subreddit r/NexusASA

Looking at the charts you will know that things didn't go well in the following two and a half months. But I decided not to panic, firstly because I had invested money I could afford to lose with some part left in stablecoins, and secondly because I knew at some point in time we will be back up. So what did I do?

Well I started DCAing, every month a small amounts, plus I was buying every time we dipped more than 10%. No emotions, just follow my plan as a machine: buy every first day of the month and always have buy orders at 10%, 20% and 30% lower than the current price.

The result? My portfolio is still happy in green, even though I haven't bought a single of the coins that did +100000000% gains in the last months. Mainly BTC, ETH, and small chunks of ALGO, XTZ, and VET. 

Have a wonderful Saturday and may we see a big green dildo on Monday.

t3_r8s1n3,"This ""crash"" was from 58k. The price action from 69k to 58k was high volume volatility.","I am presonally not all that worried. In my opinion this was a flash crash caused by the overbuying of ETH and if you were paying attention yesterday, half of the the candle was liquidated assets.

This just put the market into extreme fear, so it can be an incredible buy opportunity. If the FOLO will drive the price action lower, then its quite obviously panic selling.

I can imagine to expect news of ""XYZ"" company or El Salvador buying a ton of BTC soon.

I personally thought that the incredible buy was in range of 51-53k, before we went up to 58k. Got burned a little but that is just the market. Someone wanted to cash out a good chunk and it triggered this drop.

Bitcoin still has potential to go 100k in the coming months. Once we get a massive volume candle up people will rally. It always works both ways.

Lets see how the volume plays out. The time in march was more scary since the volume was very low after the dump.

A lot of people here have hedl for a long time, but getting cold feet after losing 5-10% of the value of your portfolio is nothing to be alarmed by, heck once I lost almost everything 90%!

For the newbies, if you are to take anything from this subreddit it should be that:
Don‚Äôt worry about missing out, don‚Äôt think that because you don‚Äôt have enough cash right now to buy the dip that you have missed out on a huge opportunity. These kinds of opportunities come and go, and you‚Äôll probably notice a lot of coins will fall and rise at different rates. Don‚Äôt start taking out loans and racking up credit card debts to jump in on the opportunity, everyone here invests as much as they can and if you‚Äôre all out, that‚Äôs fine.

t3_r8rvea,"I've added Kucoin support to my new listings crypto trading bot and the test results look promising, the code is open sourced","The idea itself is quite simple, the trading bot scans the Binance (and now Kucoin too) announcement page, and once a new listing announcement has been detected, it proceeds to trade this on gateio.

I chose gateio because they are more relaxed with coin listing, although they're janky af. This means that what Kucoin and Binance WILL list, is probably already listed on there.

Last month, I shared an update with you regarding this tool and I was really excited that the tool has actually made some money to some of the people using it.

However, the speed of execution differs a lot between one country or another, which means that it either needs to un on a VPS in Tokyo, or you have to get lucky to get in early enough.

That's mainly due to the fact that Binance is highly competitive when it comes to new listings, and it's most likely overbotted.

Another downside of the bot running exclusively on Binance is that we only get 1-3  listings a week which means there's a lot of downtime.

**Adding Kucoin announcement support would therefore solve two issues:**

*  Operating in a less competitive market, means we don't need to worry about the speed of execution as much.
* More coin listings means more opportunities to make (or lose) money.

Thanks to user busyuqboy, I have some initial test data that shows that by introducing Kucoin support to this trading bot, it seems that the tool would be consistently profitable:

KIN was bought between 7.6 and 8.5 seconds, after the announcement was made on Kucoin, depending on where the VPS was located:

SRM was detected and bought in 7.2 seconds from Barhain VPS and 4.8 seconds on the N. Virginia VPS.

So, any who. We are approaching a new year in crypto and I want to discuss everyones‚Äô investing strategy for 2022. I got into crypto almost a year ago. I started investing in February and tried out different exchanges, different coins, cold wallets, (and learned about the insane Eth-gas fee‚Äôs).

I‚Äôm finishing university now in late December and I will have a fairly well paid job starting in mid January.

I‚Äôve now come up with 3 different strategies and I‚Äôm not sure which one I will go for, so hoping for some insightful comments here.

‚Ä¢ The last of every month I Will invest ‚âà $50 USD every month in each of the top 10 coins. I will continue to do this every month no matter the price.

‚Ä¢ I invest ‚âà $12,50 USD every week in the top 10 coins. This strategy feels a little funnier because It allows me to be more active. Btw, is there any data on which of the weekdays crypto usually dips?

‚Ä¢ I invest ‚âà $50 USD every moth in 10 coins of my choice. Right now I‚Äôm thinking of BTC, ETH, SOL, Terra, Cro, Algo, Chainlink, Cosmos, Stellar, Sandbox. If I choose this I can also decide to invest $12,50 USD once a week. But then again. I would like to have some data for which day it‚Äôs best to invest.

So what strategy do you think sounds best? What‚Äôs your strategy going into 2022? Is there any day in the month or the week that it's statistically better to invest on? Did Jeffrey Epstein really kill himself? How can Pete Davidsson date all those women?

I thought these values are based (out of thin Air
Mostly) individually on their projects or visions or whatever word salad crap that gets put on on their mysterious websites. 

Which leads me to my next question. How are these coin values established sec by sec.  What information/actions/whatever dictate the ticker moving non stop for all eternity. I grasp how value is established based on‚Ä¶ coin availability‚Ä¶ money invested‚Ä¶ prospective gains from projects or visions. But what is all this twitch movement based off of sec by second. 

And i got one more for now

I hear how most coins have a set amount in circulation. Some have burns which I understand that. And those are factors in the value. But this is me trying to understand the reality concrete part of it. Let‚Äôs use a fake example with oversimplified numbers for my questions sake‚Ä¶. but represent a very real and common scenario‚Ä¶


BOTcoin is very strong and popular. They are a pioneer in crypto and have continued to stay relevant in the crypto game. Coin valued at $100 usd and showing steady gains throughout the coins history. The total coins minted are listed at  10 mil and states a burn of 1 mil early on and lists a circulation of 9 mil coins. 

This is where I am trying to intertwine crypto with the coin jar on my shelf. If I want to get into owning botcoin and I haven‚Äôt before. We know  the 9 mil in circulation number. So when I decide to purchase 100 coins. Whose 100 were they and did someone allow their 100 to be mine? But where did the $$$ go that my debit card sent to coinbase to then produce 100 coins and state I‚Äôm the owner. I‚Äôm really confused to the actual coins location bc when putting a number on circulation you are telling me there is an exact amount of coins in their own respected owners locations. So is every coin distributed and bought by exchanges kept in their vaults and then sold to whoever purchases it. Bc every coin that gets bought from fiat has to have a service,exchange, app, whatever serve as the facilitator/transporter of the coins. But where are the coins coming from that coinbase or crypto dot come are purchasing on behalf of their members????

I noticed USDT % rates increasing way more than actual stable coins eg UST and USDC that is signs of worry for the future. 

I see this as a potential opportunity to borrow USDT to buy coins and then if it‚Äôs value goes south pay off the left over debt for a fraction however would be interesting to see if the rates skyrocket on it like eg a hyper inflation currency that loses peg against the USD like Zimbabwe years ago.

Tether is a huge liquidity part of the market and can potentially wreck a lot of defi operations and with it peoples deposits.

t3_r8q7bj,Crash Theory - Capital Gains Tax,"This bull run really kicked off in late November of 2020. I have a feeling that a lot of whales in the US purchased around this time as they saw a huge buying opportunity. 

In the United States, gains are taxed in two ways: long term, and short term. Short term gains are from any position closed within one year and are taxed at a higher rate (think 25%). Long term gains are from a position closed after more than one year and are taxed at a lower rate (think 15%). 

If you had made a multi million dollar purchase of Bitcoin at $20k (roughly the price at the end of November/early December), you‚Äôd have to pay hundreds of thousands in taxes when you eventually sell due to the rise in price. Waiting until your position is qualified as long term would save you a small fortune. 

This flash crash occurred almost exactly at 12:00 am NY time as if it was a meticulously planned strategy. 

This could easily be what‚Äôs causing some selling as we are now past the one year mark for this current bull run.

As of right now, the live data on Coinglass shows there's been $2.59B of crypto Liquidations in the last 24 hours however I know that Coinglass doesn't track 100% of exchanges so the real number is easily over $3B.

t3_r90f78,What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts on PAXG?,"PAX Gold (PAXG) is an ERC-20 token (meaning it is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and other
networks that are based on Ethereum) that is pegged to one troy ounce of a 400-ounce London Gold Delivery
gold bar. Holders of PAXG tokens actually own the underlying asset, which is held by the Paxos Trust Co, and
which can be redeemed at any point.
PAXG price tracks the price of the gold it represents, which is subject to changing market conditions. The toker
seeks to make purchasing gold bullion easier, faster and more accessible through fractional ownership.
PAXG Price
Paxos Trust introduced PAX Gold in September 2019. Unlike with many cryptocurrencies, there is no maximum
supply for the asset because Paxos Trust can issue as many tokens as demand requires,
Issuance of PAXG is subject to market demand for the gold-backed token and is not subjected to a fixed
schedule. When a user redeems a PAXG token for physical gold, the corresponding PAX Gold token is burned
immediately.
Because PAXG's value is based on the price of gold, it sees regular ups and downs, Although gold is considered
a store of value, its price momentum has yielded ups and downs over the years. PAX Gold spiked to over $2,000
in January 2021 before tumbling to just below $1,700 in late February 2021. A new surge occurred in May 2021,
with the token reaching an all-time high value of $2,155.11 on May 17.
How Does PAX Gold Work?
Every PAXG token is backed by one ounce of allocated gold stored in Brink's vaults. For smaller amounts,
physical gold retailers are used to help investors redeem their tokens.
PAX uses the same consensus protocol and blockchain features as Ethereum, including access to smart
contracts.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8nqmb,Feeling anxious over the market right now? Try to (learn to) let go,"Red numbers everywhere, portfolio looking like shit, redditors telling you ""buy dip buy dip buy dip lol"" when you don't have the money to do so, redditors telling you ""lole you stressers are stoopid i just buy"", other crypto (social) media stressing you out. There's a decent chance that you might be a bit worked up over it all. If that's you, try these four tips below and just try to let go for a bit.

- The first thing you should understand is that this crash or dip or dump, or whatever you want to call it, is out of your control. Nothing you can possibly do will change any of it. Therefore, the best thing to do is absolutely nothing whatsoever.
- Second, being worried or anxious or feeling anything else over this is mostly pointless. Again, all of this is outside of your control. Feeling worried over something you cannot control is human, but pointless. Worry over things in life that you do have control over and focus your energy on dealing with these things. It will both help your mind focus on something else and dealing with other issues will make you feel better.
- Third, some practical advice: looking at the charts/markets is not going to help you. I would advise you to set a reminder for a price level that you are comfortable with and then close your browsers/apps and go do other things. And not just do other things for an hour or two, because then you'll be right back at watching the charts and right back where you are now. That's probably not how fast the market will recover (but it will recover). Go do other things for a few days. Meet some friends, read books, go fix whatever worries are withing your control.
- Fourth, I can't stress this enough: let it go, Elsa. That's not just crypto advice, that's life advice. Everything that you cannot control is not worth stressing over, so don't.

Like anything, you're not going to learn this overnight. Just keep in mind that stress is stupid, annoying, useless and unhealthy. You want as little of it in life as possible. Eventually you'll teach your brain to worry less.

I put my phone down and tried my best to think clearly and logically. Throwing all emotion out the door. 

I am no vet but I am also not an amateur. I have been holding full coins of BTC, ETH, and LTC since May 2017. This is not a brag on newbies, this is mental advice for all. Understand the insane ride I and many others have been on. This is to point out what I did and why when I saw BTC go from 2k to roughly 20k and then nosedive into a long cold hibernation years ago. 

Back then seeing 2k of BTC turn to 20k made me feel strong, smart, and just simply happy. It wasn‚Äôt life changing money but it was a lot to me and still is. But when that 20k did a nosedive and plummeted into a long cold hibernation I didn‚Äôt feel weak, dumb, and unhappy. I actually had one emotion and it was the only emotion I had subtly throughout the entire ride. That emotion was frustration. I was frustrated the ride up for not buying more and I had this same feeling riding the wave down watching all my gains burn.

Now think. Only one of those I can control and that‚Äôs the ride up - buying more. Sure you can say sell before watching it all go down. But that won‚Äôt fix anything for the ride (back) up, it‚Äôll do the opposite. You‚Äôll be really frustrated because now you have nothing to watch go up. So I took my only long term emotion of frustration by the fucking balls and BOUGHT MORE during this time. 

Last night I zoomed out, looked how far we‚Äôve come, and bought the fire sale of alt coins and also averaged some down. This is the same thing I did when BTC, ETH, and LTC had their little fire sale in 2019 after it‚Äôs old ATH.

t3_r8wyps,We need to decouple the fuck out of Bitcoin cause it's inferior to the rest of the blockchains both technologically and environmentally and it drags the rest of crypto needlessly down when it takes a 10k$/h dive!,"I mean the title says it all. Sure, we can all argue that we're still too fucking early and no matter the 2 trillion market cap, this is actually true. We're still in the infancy phase and that's true for most top 10 blockchains including Ethereum, Cardano, Solana...

Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto is coupled cause everything's paired with BTC and sometimes it's the only pairing even though Bitcoin is both technologically and environmentally inferior to most cryptos  that came after it, it still dictates the price movements of nearly everything. When the FIAT value of  BTC rises, most of other crypto seem to rise too. When grandpa BTC falls, almost every other crypto seems to take a similar even amplified beating!

BTC falls, crypto paired with BTC will fall in FIAT-value even if they have other pairings. This is because, normally, its BTC pairs would boast the highest trade volume.

So, while everyone is focused on BTC going to 1M/BTC, I can almost certainly predict that the grandpa will fail 5-10 years from and finally will be overtaken by other current top 10 crypto with strong use case like Etehreum, Cardano, Solana and hell even XRP Ledger!

t3_r8wwem,A possible gem (need your opinion)?,"# 1. Unpopularity of options in DeFi

Okay, so we all know that Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap have been very successful in DeFi. But it always occured to me why we don't have similarly famous options markets for cryptocurrencies. Well, it turns out options aren't as much popular in crypto because options (especially option selling) is a very, very risky business considering that crypto is already extremely volatile. Unless you allow Market Makers (MMs) a safe way to sell options on crypto, they will demand a way higher premium compared to Traditional Finance (TradFi). The reason why selling options against crypto that you hold is risky is that there is a very large probability you will lose everything (-100% drawdown possibility), and in TradFi people use the Black Scholes model (an Nobel prize winning tool) to price options that they want to sell in such a way so as to stay profitable. But the thing is, this model does not work for very volatile assets like cryptos.

My hypothesis is that this high premium is precisely why options are having a hard time to gain adoption (by, say, the crowd over at r/wsb for example).

# 2. Lack of ""Institutional Adoption"" of DeFi

Okay, so we all know Institutional Adoption is a meme (at least for the most part). But have you ever thought of why that is? Well, one reason is the lack of financial instruments that these institutional players are so used to in TradFi. One such instrument is hedging (via options). Now, you can't hedge your crypto positions by purchasing options if you don't have a seller on the other side willing to sell you those options at a reasonable premium in the first place (i.e. the problem of liquidity).

So, if you solve problem #1 of optimal options pricing with reasonable premiums, you effectively solve problem #2 of liquidity.

# 3. Enter PotionLabs
(*No, I have nothing to do with them neither do I hold any bags. Because, well I can't... not yet anyway*)

I've recently stumbled upon what seems to be a true crypto gem (at least that's what I think so). The guys over at @PotionLabs have effectively solved problem #1 with something they call the ""Kelly Machine"" that, apparently, outperforms the Black Scholes model in TradFi (this is huge imo!). They use a math tool called the Kelly Criterion (used to determine optimal bet size for maximum gains) and turned it on its head to instead calculate optimal premium for selling options. And it works even for extremely volatile assets like crypto!

*TLDR* --- they are effectively a Uniswap but for options (well, kind of but not exactly)!

# 3. That's all good, but what's the ticker?

There is none. They don't have a token nor do they intend to ever have one. Instead, they plan to have 10k governance NFTs on auction and the Dapp will launch in January next year.

# 4. Okay, so what do you want from this sub?

I want a second opinion (or maybe some confiation bias lol). Obviously, if it isn't already obvious from the post, I'm excited about potion. But I want to see if this is just my wishful thinking or is there really something legit here. By all means, please rip my DD to shreds. I'll be thankful for it!

I just do understand sometimes.  We are still up 750% since came back to crypto last March.  (This is down almost 400% for us)

No we have not bought at ATH so that helps us,  I dca in ethereum an average of 14 to 15 USD daily through my 4 gpu mining.

The coins/tokens we hold are all pretty much staked.  I tend to do daily research on potential new investment.

With all that said seeing thousands of dollars of net worth can be disconcerting.  It is not the end.  

Though if you stressing or becoming a bit mentally unstable either you are over leveraged, or the violitiltlly of crypto is not for you.

Then buy it back if it dips below 25% from what you sold for. If a coin really gains x100 you won't make as big of a profit, but so far I have more crypto than I would have had by just holding.

Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt know jack shit about cryptocurrency and I‚Äôm a horrible investor given that my portfolio is very red at the moment. However this week, has been informative for me in learning about defi 2.0 - OlympusDao and TIME wonderland. Same thing with me opening a position with UST on Anchor Protocol 20% apy Earn.

While thinking about how Bitcoin broke the 21 week EMA and dropped below 52k, then shot down to 42k to only find legs at 48k a random thought popped up into my head. Why ?

The most surprising part of the crash was that it didn‚Äôt happen during normal business hours (when does it ever)
in America. It didn‚Äôt happen as US stocks have been going down during open/ after hours for the last 2-3 weeks. It didn‚Äôt happen as leaders of the crypto community like Sam Bankman Fried (founder of FTX/ Alameda Research) are going to meet with government regulatory board to m discuss stablecoins this month. Sure Crypto has been going down since November 9th but how did it lose 9-15 thousand dollars in a matter of hours/2 days?

 I‚Äôm just gonna throw this out there, I believe this was a deliberate sell off by institutionalized investors + major whales. The sell wall at 69k was too great for BTc to continue to run without government oversight. In my opinion, a short retest of 40k was bound to happen after JPowell mentioned the possibility of raising interest rates, Evergrande Fud, Charlie Munger Fud, inflation disarray, stablecoin regulation, and of course our deadly foes delta+OMi. 

One thing i know is BTc and eth will hit new highs come 2022. Strap yourself in boys, it‚Äôs gonna be a bumpy ride but there‚Äôs no denying blockchains are here to stay.

t3_r8q1a0,Reflections during correction/crashes,"Not an old crypto soul here, but even a short time teaches you a lot about volatility. 

Here are some observations while navigating through rough, red seas.  

1. The ‚Äùexperts‚Äù are often wrong because there are no experts. 

Remember Plan B‚Äôs predictions for Bitcoin price? It was all the rage as if he had some magical time machine and could see the future Nov. $89K, Dec $100K blah, blah, blah. These pseudo-science ‚Äúexperts‚Äù will return again when things turn around to peddle more snake oil. Just remember how often they‚Äôve been wrong when they seem to be right (selection bias).

2. Portfolio diversification

I‚Äôm as guilty as the rest thinking I can spread risk across multiple crypto sectors. When the markets turn red though it‚Äôs clear there is no protection (unless you‚Äôve socked away some gains into stable coins.) The curves all look the same with alts generally getting hit harder than BTC, especially the smaller market caps. 

What holding in different sectors does (blockchain, layer 2‚Äôs, defi, gaming, oracles, etc.) is catch different waves on the upside. There are rotations across sectors and even within them as money seeks gains when they flatten elsewhere. 

When BTC sinks in any major way, pretty much everything sinks along with it (e.g. the entire top 100 are in the red. )

3. Better understand risk and risk tolerance

Down markets really challenge one‚Äôs approach to crypto, but one thing is certain‚Äî this is not a test of your diamond vs paper hands or any other egoist bullshit. 

It‚Äôs your money and no anonymous shit-poster on a website chat platform has your interests at heart. 

Know this deep in your bones. 

A sea of red does challenge assumptions about risk, too. Is the drop making you feel uneasy, sick to your stomach, losing sleep, excited to jump in with more hard-earned money because everything looks cheap (it may or may not be)? Did you panic sell because you needed it to pay for something short-term and you thought you could make some quick money?

Have you even noticed the prices drop or are you buying some every week/month to DCA and will for the next ten years so you don‚Äôt care?

All of this points to understanding the risks (how much and how fast prices can drop with no warning) and your personal risk tolerance. 

4. Time-frame 

(Yes, in the long run we‚Äôre all dead, but until then there‚Äôs a lot of living to do.)

A crash really highlights the value of longer time horizons. Investments in a new technology sector, a financial revolution, a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of shared benefit, is going to be a rocky road. 

How many railroad companies went bankrupt even though the steam engine revolutionized transport or tech companies all chasing internet gold? A lot. Most even. 

It‚Äôs impossible to know 100% which ones will succeed, but there are educated guesses. Doing some research is important, especially during down markets.

t3_r8m3qs,So you wanna leverage trade huh? How to get absolutely rekt.,"THIS POST IS DESIGNED TO EMPHASISE HOW DANGEROUS LEVERAGE TRADING IS!!! 

So when I got into crypto I had no idea what margin trading involved, but I knew from the degeneracy I'd seen on the internet that people either made absolute bank or got rekt into oblivion. This is a post going through the BARE basics of what margin trading is (stuff I wish someone had told me!). There's obviously a lot more to it and I'd love if people could contribute in the comments or advise me of any inaccuracies in my post. This post was inspired by u/YuzuDaddy's post today. 


People are getting liquidated ‚Äì what the f\*\*k does that mean?

&amp;#x200B;

**Firstly ‚Äì what is margin trading?**

At its core you are borrowing funds and providing collateral at a specific ration. For example, if you want to open a deal for $10,000 with a 10:1 leverage you need to open a position with $1000 of your own capital.

**What positions can you hold?**

Simple: long or short

Long position = You expect to make $$$ from growth in the asset‚Äôs price

Short position = You expect to make $$$ from the decrease in the asset‚Äôs price

**How does this work?**

Say for example you open a long position on ETH with $1000, with a 10:1 leverage. Because of your leverage if the price rises by 1% the profit would be $100. Without leverage your profit would have been $10. Tempting right? No, this is how people YOLO their savings and get destroyed.

**How do you get rekt leverage trading?**

By the liquidation price. This describes the price at which your funds would be liquidated. This is multi-factorial and depends on your position (long vs short), the leverage and the amount of funds sitting in your account.

Profit or Loss = Initial margin x %price movement x leverage

**Getting liquidated**

Liquidation % = 100/Leverage

Say you invest $100 in ADA and then use 5x leverage on your position. This means that you will be borrowing $400 to increase your trading position to $500. Say in this example the price of ADA rises by 20% - this means that your profit is now $100 (compared to $20 if you had not participated in leverage trading).

In the above example with 5x leverage your collateral will become liquidated and the exchange will forcibly close your position if the price of ADA moves 20% against your position.

**How do people avoid getting liquidated (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DYOR)**

In general by establishing a stop loss ‚Äì this instructs the exchange to sell the asset when a particular price.

3 things are considered:

1. Stop price
2. Sell price
3. Size of asset sold

Example: Your account has $5000. Say you have an initial margin of $3000 and open a position with 3x leverage to create a position of $9000 which you place entirely in SOL. By placing a stop loss at 2% from the entry position. In this instance you would lose $180, representing 3.6% of their account size.

Keep in mind that since no data identifying you will be collected, I urge you to please be honest and only comment that you have participated if you really have participated.*

Dear [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/)cc family,

For my master thesis in behavioural finance, I am conducting a **study on cognitive biases in cryptocurrency investors, with the moderating role of Reddit in mind.**

In order to test my hypothesis and research questions, I need data, and [I have designed this short survey for that purpose.](https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2) It will take you approximately 10 minutes to fill in.

**NO personal identity data will be asked for, nor collected (no names, email address etc).**

The topic of cognitive biases in retail cryptocurrency investors and the moderating role of social media in driving these biases remains a vastly under-researched topic (unfortunately). I believe this topic to be extremely relevant today, especially in such a high frequency market as cryptocurrencies. This is your chance to help participate in filling this crucial research gap.

[You can find the survey here.](https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2)

Please feel free to share it in your circles: the more respondents, the more data, and the more accurate the statistical results will be.

I will of course be posting my concluded thesis once it is completed, so that anyone interested in the results can read it.

If you do decide to participate in the survey, please carefully read the indications, questions, and please answer as accurately as possible.

Thank you all very much in advance for helping advance scientific research in cryptocurrencies and investor behaviour!!!

*Let me know in the comments if you have participated in the survey to enter the raffle for 100 moon reward (and please be honest)*

I am taking a small break from reddit to enjoy dinner, and will keep on replying to everyone later tonight. For anyone wondering - i will be posting the results along with my finished research paper around January, once I have completed my defence of my thesis! Thank you all again!

Edit2: damn thats a lot of comments. I‚Äôm trying to answer everyone, but i‚Äôm starting to get lost, so sorry if you dont get a reply, i‚Äôm trying my best! Appreciate you all and thanks for doing this!

Edit3: It seems like many of you are asking this so I will clarify to make it easier for everyone, me included haha! I will be sharing the results of my research and the thesis itself in case you want to read the whole thing in January, after the defence. I will most likely make a proper post out of it, highlighting the key results, but in case you don't want to miss it, you can use the ""remind me!"" bot in the comments to this post, as I will also add the link to my results post in this post.

t3_r8y1lu,What is the easiest way to make a separate day trading account.,"My current tactic in the crypto world is to DCA and HODL. So far, it‚Äôs worked pretty well.

I want to keep this separate from my DCA and HODL account. I figure that will make it easier for me to file my capital gain taxes.

t3_r8fzld,Why the Dip is Bothering You.,"1. You think crypto is a quick get rich scheme. It is a get rich scheme but not a quick one*. (*unless you get lucky and your coin gets chosen by a pump and dump group OR your coin is subject to actual institutional use, you won't get rich quickly). 

2. You think you are in a casino and expect results immediately. In a casino the odds are against you and the chances of losing everything is astronomically high. I have learned that unless you don't do any research and invest in shit coins, yout chances of losing everything in crypto is almost 0. 

3. You have never invested before. This is your first time. Popping your investment cherry **via** crypto by getting in somewhere in the middle or the top of a bullrun is like losing your virginity to someone you were never interested in but you did it anyway because you didn't know what you were doing, you didn't really think it through, and didn't expect the **post-nut** clarity to hit so hard. 

4. You invested way more than you thought you could afford to lose. 

5. You didn't price average. You went all in and gave 0 cash to buy anymore.

6. You never cared about the technology in the first place. Because if you did, why would you care if the price is going down? 

7. You didn't do any research. And you never zoomed out. 

8. You didn't diversify. 

9. You didn't buy any BTC or ETH. Whenever there is a BTC dip, all alts ***usually*** dip twice or three times worse. Ethereum usually drops the least due to a BTC sell off. So if you don't want to hold any BTC, consider ETH instead. 

10. You are putting a lot of your hopes in crypto. Man, this is the saddest thing I see again and again on this sub. So many people make posts here saying: 

&gt; before crypto I thought I would work until I was lowered into my casket. But now? Man, I have hope that I won't. 

This is great and all and I'm glad crypto is giving you hope, but if a temporary dip is bothering you, you have bigger problems you need to resolve. It is like getting into a relationship while being depressed and expecting having a partner to fix your emotional problems. I don't blame anyone for doing this. Just stating an observation.


11. You never had an exit strategy and watched the price skyrocket and then plummet. If you don't have one, then make one. 

------

In short, find out at what price will you cash out. Let's say you bought BTC at $69000. If you are on an exchange put a sell order at $1,000,000 and uninstall your CEX app. It might hit the price you will sell it, it might not. Everything in between doesn't matter. If you don't want to use an exchange, then get portfolio tracker and put a price alert for when you will sell. Then transfer your crypto to your own wallet and unsubscribe from any subreddit that gives you anxiety. 


If none of this bothers you, welcome to the club. Sit back, use your reserve cash to buy more to average down if you didn't go all in, and then enjoy the ride.",CryptoCurrency

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 saying hackers had stolen the equivalent of $460 million (740,000 BTC aka 6% of all BTC in existence at that time) from its online coffers. The news rocked the bitcoin world, and news outlets allover the world said it could even bring down the much-hyped digital currency forever... 

Mt. Gox was a messy combination of poor management, neglect, and raw inexperience. It was initially created by XRP co founder Jed McCaleb in 2010, sold to Mark Karpeles in March 2011 who was a big reason for the rise and uktimate failure of the exchange.

For anyone new or freaking out pls zoom out at a year trend. Annual cycles are crucial to understand in crypto, like in any complex time series. 

ETH: Showed massive resistance and still stays at a positive slope that allows for rapid growth of value. 

BTC: Although it didn't have the same resistance as ETH and its current annual trend doesn't show signs of rapid growth, it shows long term stubbornness. Meaning that it's starting to have a baseline people can depend on.

What does this mean?
This makes sense given the room ETH has to grow with meta verse and defi. 
BTC also makes sense given it's primary utility of being store of value. Less variability and more stubbornness makes it easy to have it be comparable to a gold standard. 
ETH and BTC are in different phases so if you plan to invest, try to understand them independently.

1 - Stock market corrected due to overall extension of valuations + Powell comments on inflation no longer transitory, faster tapering, and rise in interest rates. This especially hurts high growth stocks in particular which saw the steepest declines

2- The above plus omicron spooked investors and created uncertainty (which investors HATE) due to countries shutting down travel which slows down economic recovery and exacerbates supply chain

4- As a result crypto started to fall, and I don‚Äôt have access to the data but in the past what has happened is funds that were over leveraged get liquidated once prices fall and that happens exponentially as prices fall more which is why i think crypto instantly fell 20% across the board 

5 - As a result I think this liquidation provides a good discount in the crypto markets and I‚Äôve personally added to my positions (SOL, LUNA, ATOM, AVAX)

t3_r8r5d1,Pullbacks and healthy corrections,"People keep saying ""dip"", ""crash"", and ""bear"". It is like saying ""good bye"" to your money or gains. Their definitions are not set in stone. There's no reason to use those terms, or a set of rules that specifies what is correct and what is not*

So do yourself and everybody else a favor, say instead ""pullback"" and ""healthy correction"". It is less like saying ""good bye"" and more like saying ""see you later"". It is just a break, a short pause, in a never ending bull.

Finally, if you really need the hopium, take a chart and draw the prices bouncing back up as fast as they went down and reaching ATH by EOY. Make two lines as a channel, say that's technical analysis. But don't overdose with hopium, i.e. don't FOMO. Instead, keep the DCA, and don't own for 10 minutes what you would not like to own for 10 years.

t3_r8kd6a,‚ÄúBuy when there‚Äôs blood on the streets‚Äù,"*‚ÄúBe Greedy When Others Are Fearful‚Äù*

This is one of my favorite Warren Buffet quotes. I think it perfectly applies to the crypto market right now. We all know (if you truly believe in the fundamentals) that over a long enough timeframe, the market will trend up. So if you liked something when it was expensive, shouldn't you like it even more when it's cheap? If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions. 

The ones who truly make life changing gains are the ones with true conviction, who keep buying when there's blood on the streets. I know it's a meme but you gotta truly be ""in it for the tech"". You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of selling at the wrong time and miss out on the massive inevitable recovery like many will. Investing is all about having a longer time preference. DCA is always the best strategy starting out.

t3_r8izi5,Some perspective my friends!,"Listen, this is going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some tips I‚Äôve learned over the last 1.5 years.

1. Make time goals: mine is 10 years, it‚Äôs easier said than done but really zoom out and if you can look further out this is normal.

2. Don‚Äôt worry about Bull and Bear markets. Just DCA and hold. Any time I‚Äôve traded, it‚Äôs never worked out well.

3. The most gains I have made was when there was blood in the streets‚Ä¶this last July, every coin I bought is up. Ethereum at 1700.00, BTC at 30K, Dot at 15.00, Link at 16.00. In a years time you will thank yourself for DCA and Hold.

4. Don‚Äôt get caught up in ‚ÄúBuying the Dip‚Äù because you are trying to catch a falling knife, DCA and hold, you will buy the bottom.

5. Don‚Äôt EVER buy crypto with money you NEED, it will consume you, you won‚Äôt sleep looking at RED and knowing you took a loan out for crypto, or used savings for crypto. I stopped my 401k last year and every 2 weeks I use 10% of my net pay. Honestly since then I hardly ever check the charts. When is the last time you feverishly checked your 401k 20 times a day.

6. If you are RED and really stressed, just remember to remind yourself why you got into this. Write your goals down, on a white board, post them on a wall, something you can see every day and remember you are working towards it. 

7. If your thoughts are dark, reach out to someone‚Ä¶",CryptoCurrency

The crypto market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient, don't forget that!","The entire market and world economy just can't run away from the current state that we are living in - in the state of a worldwide pandemic that is affecting all world economies and it triggered a panic state for institutional investors and that heavily reflects towards the everyday retail investors that are starting to make panic driven decision making - which pulls the market down. 

Now if you are in a state of fear, the best thing you can do is to take a step back. There is absolutely no place for panic decisions, especially cutting losses with a holding that you have great trust in. 

This is a crucial part of the game, and we barely talk open about this as we usually tend to forget about this feeling and state during bullish cycles in the market, well all until reality comes knocking hard.

Some of you might see this as a perfect opportunity for purchasing new tokens, but in general, you have to take in account that you might experience great fluctuations in the short-term and you have to make sure that you can financially afford these kind of decisions. 

The best thing you as a investor can do right now is to patiently wait until this storm passes through, and take this as a great investment lesson that will prepare you for future bear market conditions.

t3_r8pl8c,"Dips, crashes and lessons learned","So, now that the market is heavily going down some new investors may feel like they made the biggest mistake of their lives. I started investing a year ago and I know what you're feeling right now.

Lesson number 1
Is this a big dip? Is this a crash? Nobody knows, and the only way to protect your money is to HODL because prices will go back up. If you start trading thinking you know what you're doing you're going to lose money, almost guaranteed.

Lesson number 2
Do not, and I can't stress this enough, do what other people tell you to do. The ""experts"" make predictions every day and most of the time they are wrong. And if the ""experts"" get it wrong, listening to reddit will certainly not be a better idea. You see projects that you think will have value in the future? Go for them. Do not buy every coin that this sub thinks will moon or you will lose money. 

Lesson number 3
Invest most of your money in solid and proven projects like ETH and BTC that you know will still be there in the future. If you put the majority of your assets in a risky investment thinking you will become rich in 2 weeks you will likely lose money. The key is to diversify. 

Lesson number 4
DO buy shitcoins. They are a way to make a lot of money out of nothing and these opportunities will not last forever. 
Putting all your money into them is incredibly stupid because most of them will fail but you should choose a number of them that you think are actually solid projects or that have the potential to moon.

Lesson number 5
Stop looking at charts, they will only give you anxiety and there's nothing you can do to effectively time the market. If you can spare enough money you should DCA during the month, otherwise invest when you have it. Do not in any case go into debt to invest thinking you will be able to repay the loan and make a profit. It is the best way to ruin yourself and your family.

Lesson number 6
Each time you read that someone became a millionaire with 8000 dollars and feel the urge to invest everything in a shitcoin stop and think about the fact that there are thousands of people that lost everything doing that. You will most likely not be that lucky guy.

I hope you all become very rich, see you on the moon.

I remember the times when Bitcoin used to drop by a **HUGE** amount in a span of few hours. The average crypto investor was stacking his satoshis, went to sleep, seeing his Bitcoin at steady pace. Then he woke up, had some coffee, did his morning routine while praying to Crypto gods, especially Satoshi, the Chosen. Went to his 9-5 job, during the job watched charts briefly. After end of the shift, he came home, had another coffee, did his home stuff, checked charts, smiled and grinned and then after sometime went to sleep peacefully. 

Very next day he woke up, seeing that Bitcoin dropped by 80%. Guy didn‚Äôt even flinched, or shat himself, he just lifted his shoulders like ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô, while feeling sad that his investments are gone and he doesn‚Äôt have any more of **FIAT** money to spare. 

Even though the market of crypto is way bigger, dips like now are shit compared to how the average day looked not too long ago. When covid disease started, BTC dropped ~50% from $9.500 to around $4.500. It‚Äôs not even 2 years ago that this happened.

Here is what has been announced so far:

December 1st: SOL (Solana) is now available on Flexa.

December 2nd: All December long, Regal Movies guests save 20% on their next two purchases when using Flexa at any Regal theater location.

December 3rd: SPEDN app now supports DAI stable coin

December 4th: SPEDN app now supports SUSHI

**What is Flexa?**

Flexa is a digital payment platform that allows users to spend cryptocurrencies with over 41,000 retail merchants using the Flexa network across the US and Canada. It is currently the fastest and most fraud proof system 

**How does Flexa Work**

Flexa uses AMP token as collateral to ensure any crypto payments will guarantee the merchant gets paid as soon as the transaction is made at the point of sale. No more waiting for transaction confirmations with crypto. If there is any issue with the payment, the AMP tokens used are paid to the merchant.

The European Commission's investigation revealed that some traders at the banks, involved in trading G10 currencies, had exchanged sensitive information and trading plans with each other. Using an online chatroom called **Sterling Lads,** they had also occasionally coordinated their trading strategies.  The sharing of information enabled them to make more informed decisions about when to buy or sell currencies and reduce risk compared to if they were operating alone. 

 It also allowed for collaboration on occasion such as the practice of standing down where one trader would hold off making a trade to avoid interfering with another trader. 

These colluding  happened between 2007 and 2013. But to the retail trader the message is clear, its not just enough that the big guys have nearly unlimited money they get at 0% interest rates, they will try any thing to make fools out of the small guy.

If this is happened with the big banks, it certainly happens with the big crypto traders. The advantages of such a cartel is far too lucrative to pass up.

It doesn't mean sell everything, it simply means start being more cautious, and have a decent cash:invested ratio.

Here's waht I have to say:

Hi everyone.

I wanted to make this post due to the obscene amount of ""buy the dip,"" ""what do i buy,"" and ""here's a list of what to buy "" posts; the greed in the air is absurd. The comments on every post, green or red day, have the current form: ""hmmmmm what are we buying? what's a good long-term buy?"" Few comments I see realize what's ahead. Pullbacks in the market are directly attributed to news as being a CAUSE not a CATALYST.

So, I would like to comment on the overall state of the market, where it's heading, and perhaps on the amount of different perspectives about the market sharply decreasing. It may be a lengthy post, but I heavily recommend you consider this point of view. Here, I present you with many charts supporting the fact that a major crash (not a pullback) is coming, and that ""buying the dips"" too early will erase the profits you obtained these past couple years.

I want to start off by showing you the [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/gB23ZTa) since the covid crash, it's a 30-day running volatility index. It's breaking out of the pattern that has formed since pandemic has begun. Now take a look at the zoomed out [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/uIwnFos), it'll give you an idea of what you would see on this chart in case the market gets into dangerous territory.

Moving onto the stock market, I'd like to show you some short and long-term patterns developing on indices, individual stocks, and the market as a whole.

First, here's the [SPY trend](https://imgur.com/xDRCcQv) that has developed since the pandemic begun. This pattern has not broken yet, but the momentum looks like it's moving into the dangerous sell area (below 0). I only show you this unbroken pattern so that you can carefully watch the development of the market. Now [zoom out](https://imgur.com/r3cu35o) to see the entirety of SPY's price action. The highlights and ratios are Fibonacci retracement ratios, they're simply mathematical ratios (developed from the Fibonacci sequence) that appear with a strangely-high frequency in nature, price movements of assets, and other areas of life. Anyway, I want to point out that the major major support that SPY has is at the price level of the 2000 and 2008 highs (somewhere around the $160ish area, a 65% pullback. That mark is the best case end-scenario for a market ""pullback""/""crash"" that we are looking at here, in my opinion. A smaller drop off sets the charts up for a larger drop later on, and a more violent drop (simply a retest of the 1994-2008 lows of SPY, i.e. $80ish) would still fit a ""very long term bullish american economy"" type of scenario (and is a very real possibility if fear overtakes folks enough).

Let's switch our attention to QQQ, the tech trust. Here's the entire price history of [QQQ](https://imgur.com/ylxodYD), in one chart. The case 1 support I have drawn up in the chart is very very likely not going to be the final bottom of the crash, but could very well be the relief area once things do start crashing. As you can see though, QQQ is in a parabolic state right now -- here the gains you miss out on by exiting early are the greatest, but the so is the risk of you staying in each one of those trades. As uncertainty grows, the investing and the gambling games start seeming more and more the same. Here's the [chart of TQQQ](https://imgur.com/VJGVdro). For those who do not know, it aims to reflect the daily returns on QQQ threefold. I saw many posts and comments saying they buy TQQQ on dips, and that TQQQ is up 20000% in a decade, so why wouldn't someone just buy TQQQ and wait. Please look up leveraged ETFs and try to understand that losses are amplified SIGNIFICANTLY in any of those types of ETFs, and they WILL get brought down painfully low during the incoming crash/pullback/whatever you want to call it.

It's very important to understand that price action is like the motion of a pendulum, it oscillates around a ""fair value/price"" (which also moves in a longer-term cycle); it's important to remember that the pendulum always eventually swings back to that ""fair"" value that noone technically knows for sure. What's also important is that swings do not ever stop at the actual fair value, they swing past with momentum, and the more violent the swing one way (regardless of whether it's up or down), the more violent the swing back will be.

Anyway, we can also go ahead and look at individual stocks. Let's take one of the strongest of them all, [GOOGL](https://imgur.com/uGlmzWr). Even this stock has had parabolic price action since becoming public. As you can see, even this strong stock has some room to drop off (perhaps the chart does imply this is one of those tickers that would do slightly better than the market in cases of a crash). The momentum on this has STARTED to slow down, but has not gone to the sale side of price action just yet, implying that we are starting to find the top, and slow down in the price discovery.

There's a point I also wanted to make about banking and financial institution stock tickers, as I hear the general way of reasoning here be something along the lines of ""interest rates will be going up, that directly benefits these institutions/companies."" While that line may be true, it's not the factor that most importantly decides which way the stock ticker will move. In the case of a crash/pullback, everything gets entangled. Specifically, we can look at [Bank of America](https://imgur.com/VWpn7Sq) as a good example here. This is one of the ""strong stock"" charts with the most concerning volume development, in my opinion. The absurd divergence has lasted well over a decade, and while BAC hasn't found it's very clear top/peak, we can see that that peak in price is nearby (if it hasn't already happened ofcourse, but I doubt it for this chart). I also am very weary of these types of banking stocks being around the peak prices of 1999-2008 era, combined with the volume divergence I was talking about, as well as the growing greed of everyday investors.

Alright, now I'd like to take a moment and direct your attention to the [DXY chart](https://imgur.com/oQs4R6W); this is the dollar currency index, it's basically the value of the US dollar, measured against a basket of other world currencies. The break above 93.5 on this chart is where we first saw the market pull back slightly more than was expected by the average trader. Long term, I see [two cases](https://imgur.com/QgglDU1) related to what happens to the US dollar. I won't comment on what would cause either of the cases; however, from the viewpoint of technical analysis, a major move is expected on this DXY chart in the coming years/decade. The FED has been printing money for almost a full year now, here's a [chart](https://imgur.com/ihobATQ) quantifying that printed amount. To add, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/D7wT86L) of annual inflation reports each month, showing obviously-dangerous levels of inflation. I don't have much comment to make here, but do be aware of this information please.

As my final couple points, I want to emphasize that I see everyone's points and strategies getting more and more similar; it's incredibly dangerous to blindly buy the dip or follow the general public, consider revising the possible perspectives on this issue. As you see people's emotions swinging more and more wildly side to side, you should be getting more and more cautious about the state of the current markets.

PLEASE CONSIDER READING THIS: there's a book called ""a random walk down wall street."" In the first chapter, it outlines the major bubbles in the past couple centuries. It's worth a read. Highly recommend.

Edit: Please please please stop buying the current dip. And please remember to zoom out, and not follow the heard, but rather study it. I'd also like to add that if you REALLY zoom out, zoom out 300-400 years ago, this is the chart you will see.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/blUB5we) is a great chart that Robert Prechter put together (the guy behind Elliott Wave Theory). There is a video out there where he talks about what a Fibonacci pattern he notices in the market. Look it up if you are interested, I am not allowed to give you the link here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: This is the time to be CAUTIOUS in the market, regardless of which market you are talking about. If you have unrealized profits on the table, consider securing a portion (perhaps a majority) of those profits. If you are facing a negative return on any position, do not close your phone or uninstall your app to simply wait for a year; you MUST reevaluate your positions, and adjust accordingly. Do not panic, but remember to stay weary of the ""heard"" mentality about markets -- the market always finds a way to humble its investors.",CryptoCurrency

Why I like this coin

1. It's fun!¬† I chuckle every time I open my wallet and see it there. Given my history of buying high with several coins I've owned, I can relate to their story.

2. Low market cap and low supply (compared to other memes)¬† As of this post MC is around 5 Million and supply is around 73 Billion.¬† No quintrillions to deal with.

3. They are have made some fun projects:

a. They have staking

b. They have games (loser land, peachland stone gate, loser poker, lowb craft (in progress)

c. They have NTF's

d. They have a loser bridge that allows exchange of crypto assets (Ethereum, Binance, Smart Chain, Matic blockchain)¬†

e. They probably have some other things going on that I'm not entirely aware of, overall I'm pretty new to the coin :)

e. I put in enough to where I will make a lot if it takes off but won't cry if it dies


The not so great

1. It's a meme coin-some folks hate meme coins.¬† I happen to like meme coins that have a purpose, which I think LOWB is

2. Their marketing hasn't been great from what I've observed, so I don't think a lot of folks know about it.¬†¬†

The truth is everyone is just panic selling and that panic is driven solely by the idea people are losing money. 

It's hard watching it but you should always measure your portfolio value against Bitcoin. If you had to consolidate entirely into BTC, how much would you get? How much could you get when your portfolio was at it's peak?

Here we are, 6 months later getting ready to launch our first piece of software together, with an open beta planned for Q1 2022.

The process had it's challenges, but the thing that really amazes me personally is the fact that we had to actually start trusting each other in order to properly work on this. Especially since we had to pool together the money for incorporating the business and everything. I am happy to report that all of us are still together and no one ran with the moolah.

Here are some of the highlights so far:

* The trading algorithm supports a number of signals, from volatility to technical analysis, making it easy to implement complex trading systems that are fully automated.
* We decided to work with AWS secret manager in order to keep your API keys securely stored.
* We've laid out the foundation of Social Trading! In the future you will be able to simply clone another user's bot.
* The tool's name is Aesir - because we're all Norse mythology geeks.

t3_r8q2py,4 probable reasons for this crash that I could identify by going through a lot of articles and posts.,"1. SEC rejecting spot ETF for bitcoin: Many traders/ investors pumped their money into the crypto world with the hope that there would be a spot ETF for bitcoin which would increase the demand of Bitcoin (crypto) and hence the prices would surge, however SEC rejected the idea.  

2. Evergrande crisis: A China giant, unable to fulfill their debt obligations. This should have some repercussions on stable-coins tied to USD and thus will have an indirect impact on Crypto as a whole.  

3. Major economies with their negative or regulatory stance on cryptocurrency: India trying to restrict the trade of cryptocurrencies to a certain native exchanges. China considering punitive electricity charge for crypto mines, and so on. Extra bullish stance on bitcoin by leaders like the president of El Salvador is not helping either- instead it is creating a negative image of our community as a whole.  

4. Liquidation of leveraged traders: Cryptocurrencies worth several billion dollars were liquidated forcing a negative loop of selling cycle. Even bitcoin worth several billions were liquidated. Every passing hour more and more traders are getting liquidated.

t3_r8pzev,Crash Dip Correction blah blah blah,"If you feel anything at all when the market falls 10% you‚Äôre either:
In crypto for the wrong reasons
Over invested
Both of the above.

Firstly if you are seriously worried regarding the dip i‚Äôm not belittling you or judging but you chose to invest which isn‚Äôt my responsibility.

The wrong reasons:
Crypto is meant to fix something, whether its currency, SOV, defi, NFT or anything else.  The price of your crypto doesn‚Äôt really affect its use case.  The only reason you‚Äôd care is if you were in crypto for the money which is referenced below.

Over invested:
Now if you‚Äôre in crypto for the money then fair enough, i‚Äôm not judging but investing bears risk and its up to you to educate yourself on that risk.  Nothing in this space even bitcoin is completely safe.
Everyone is told not to invest more than they can afford to lose, i‚Äôve read it probably 1000 times on this sub, if the money you‚Äôve invested makes you feel ill losing it‚Ä¶ take it out either next pump or right now depending on your desperation.  If you feel the need to sell at a loss.. you‚Äôre probably over invested.

Summary-
If you are scared right now, evaluate why you‚Äôre scared right now.

When scrolling through this sub right now I see many people freaking out and spreading FUD. I have been in crypto since 2016, so I have a bit of experience. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don't mean that everything is okay, but hear me out.

The market always moves in Cycles. There are always ups and downs. In the last Bull run (2017/2018) there were 5 major dips, all with BTC dropping by \~40%. It had always  recovered and so this it will this time. Follow these steps:

1. **Ask yourself: is the Cryptospace and the technology behind it future-proof?** Did the fundamentals that started making you believe in this changed? Surely not. Crypto is just at the beginning and even if we are not super early, we are still early enough before mass adoption comes, so we are actually good! No matter where you bought in, how big your unrealised loss is at the moment, the chances of you buying the exact ATH it will ever reach is 0. The market will recover, chase new ATH, dip again, recover and so on. Sure, this dip is scary as hell, but if you can afford to hold - DO IT! I don‚Äôt know when, if in 2 days, 2 weeks, months or even years, but you will see profit and get at least what you invested back.
2. Also, as everyone says (and almost nobody listens to), always remember to only invest what you can afford to lose! If your portfolio ist currently down and you need that money, here‚Äôs what to do: **DONT TRY CHASING LOSSES**
   1. ‚Äã **Ask yourself: Do I need the money in the next few weeks?** Sell 20% now and watch the markets. If they recover, wait, if they don‚Äôt, sell another 20% and so on. That way you‚Äôll still keep something in case the market goes back up and cashed out a bit in case everything goes down the drain even further. Only do so if you really need that money in the next week or so, otherwise see 1. and please don‚Äôt repeat that mistake in the future.
   2. ‚Äã Last but not least: **LEARN from the dip!** I know it‚Äôs quite exciting to double, triple or whatever multiply your portfolio but don‚Äôt fall for greed! Keep in mind that stocks in general rise about \~7% per year, gains that you make here on a good day. Crypto is a risky investment, that‚Äôs why the possible returns are so much higher. Next time you have made some profit, think about selling and realising gains. Everybody has seen the posts of 15 year olds with 7 digit portfolios, but how many of them cashed out and really bought the lambo? Most of them kept gambling and lost a significant amount if not all afterwards. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you to HODL if you feel uncomfortable and made some juicy gains - leave! It‚Äôs your life, your money and only your decision!

**TL;DR** Don‚Äôt panic, prices will rise someday in the future, you only lose if you sell at loss. If you need that money urgently, sell in small portions. Take time to overthink your strategy and maybe next time don‚Äôt let FOMO take over. Also remember that is better to go home with some nice 30% realised gains, rather than 400% unrealised gains.

&amp;#x200B;

 

When it comes to cryptocurrency there is probably nothing more important than ""*Do your own research*"".

Do Your Own Research, say English speakers. DYOR.

There is a lot of information out there and it can be difficult to understand what is real and has potential, what is real and doesn't have much potential, or what is there just waiting to rip you off. However, if you really want to commit, you need to learn how to do your research - let's see how you figure out if it's a crypto to stay away from or perhaps worth holding.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not a financial advisor. I don't advise you how to invest your money. I don't help anyone use this majestic network of blockchains and dapps. Investing your money and making it bear fruit is everyone's dream, and if it becomes a path that you want to take, the only advice I give is to do it with extreme caution.

&amp;#x200B;

 

## 1st Phase: Market activity

The first step in starting a research on the best cryptocurrency X100 will do in two weeks is to ask yourself: **this coin is economically active**? I've seen so many promising cryptocurrency projects, only to then verify how active a currency is within the market and‚Ä¶ it's been dead for months or even years.

### What to do?

Go to a site like coinmarketcap.com or coingeko.com to see if it is a live currency, if there is any activity, transactions made with it, be sure to check the trading volume and how the price is moving.

Not only should that token be listed within an Exchange with a good reputation, but the trading volume in that market should also be quite high, I would say significant: if it wasn't, you might find yourself paying a '*premium option* since the *order book* they did not circulate liquidity enough.

If the token you're looking at is an ERC20 protocol token, which is traded almost exclusively on DEX like Uniswap, be sure to proceed with caution, as DEXs don't have unsurpassed pricing criteria or requirements. All of this isn't THE reason to leave a project out, but it's something to keep in mind as you move forward.

Price is key, but that's not all. Let's assume that the cryptocurrency you have chosen has a legitimate economic boost. It's time to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it is and how it works.

DYOR.

## 2nd Phase: The initial research

Youtube is definitely a good place to start. But there is a lot of chaos. That's why my advice is to switch by **Messaria**, **Binance Research**, and from an ICO monitoring site such as **Icodrops**. Pretend Going Back To School: When using these resources be sure to take notes and jot down any questions you may have. Now you won't need them, you won't find the answers. But right now you are not trying to get those answers but you are starting a journey.

**Messari is a powerful tool** that you can use to analyze cryptocurrencies. The section that I think you should be interested in is that of the crypto profile you are interested in. Messari guys do a comprehensive analysis that includes cryptocurrency history, tokenomics, and token allocations. They come to an incredibly detailed level and even a timeline of past development and fundraising as well as a roadmap for the future of the project.

Write down the names of all the key people involved in the project, ie the founder and the CEO (assuming they are not the same person) .. you will need them later.

**Research done by Binance** instead they take a more technical approach to analyzing any token. It is extremely helpful to have research with this cut, to understand the main components of crypto and how it works.

The great thing about the research generated by Messari and Binance is that because they are the Hollywood stars in the crypto space, a high degree of professionalism is expected of them. They are not just fat cows: the information on Messari and Binance is not up to date. You can't really blame them: they're doing so much more‚Ä¶ but that's okay too. It is already a first slap that is telling you: do not take anything written by a third party as pure gold, as an excuse to put an end to all your research, even if that source is very well known.

**ICO tracking sites, like Icodrops, are a kind of time machine**: for certain crypto they have made available old images and documentation that is no longer available on the website. So it's easy to spot if a cryptocurrency project has changed the direction it was going, or if it's simply trying to bury the past. Unfortunately the total amount of money raised that is reported by Icodrops and similar sites is not always accurate, and tends to include all funds raised both in private funding rounds and through multiple ICOs. Remember to always look for pictures or charts where you can clearly see the breakdown of the token, how the money was collected and where the tokens were assigned.

Messari does a good job of tracking token funding and allocations - you can cross this information with Icodrops to get clear on how a given crypto project has increased its capital. What you are looking for here is a token allocation that doesn't make you want to run away .. specifically you want to make sure that most of the tokens that have been issued or will be issued are in the hands of the community and not in the pockets of the people who founded the project! Holders of most tokens could potentially sell when the price starts to rise, which would prevent the coin from growing in value organically.

As before, it is not that if this condition is lost, the whole project is a project to be discarded. But you have to be very careful when you see an image like this, checking the tokenomics of a crypto on Binance Research or Messari:

&amp;#x200B;

 

Now that you've checked everything out, it's time to head back to Youtube. Since you trust that crypto, now that you have a good understanding of it, let's hear what those who created it have to say. Pick up the names you remembered to write, the names of the key people involved in the project. Your next task will be to find the most recent interviews they've done. Arrange them in chronological order and watch as many as you can!

DYOR.

## 3rd Phase: Research the Sources

Seeing is believing: Watching interviews with key members of the crypto project you follow offers a treasure trove of information you won't find anywhere else. Furthermore, these interviews often help me a lot to understand the technical elements of a project that I might have a hard time understanding simply by reading the documentation, almost often found on the crypto site. While you're at it, check LinkedIn profiles to see if they have good credentials. If they worked in Google or Microsoft is it good? Yes, if the hiring did not last a few months. If they were fired because they were mining crypto, then *gimme five*! Search the Youtube channel of the crypto currency you are interested in! If you are good at researching, you will find short videos explaining the main components of the project.

This adds two more steps to the search: *fact check*, always, everything you have learned so far, and try to understand what is in store in the future of this cryptocurrency.

DYOR.

## Step 4: Double check: double check

Have you already been to a crypto website to be overwhelmed by tons of information? You only want to read the home page and the information section. Most of the information about a particular crypto site tends to be a bunch of trivia. Obviously, banking and non-banking transactions or some other noble cause they claim to support. Most of the content in general is useless and won't be helpful in figuring out if the project deserves your attention. Most importantly, you risk wasting a lot of time browsing their site if you don't know what you are looking for. But since you remembered to write down the names of the key components of this project and you wrote down all the questions you wanted an answer to ... well then it's time to verify that everything you learned still applies and solves your questions that they have arisen since you began your research.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lh2a5hrt8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d964ca29622c912ecd8c497d1315482a4f8968

 

You can find many of the answers by digging into the section dedicated to Documentation .. maybe you are lucky and there is also a search bar and you can enter terms such as **tokenomics**, **inflation**, **ICO**, **consent mechanisms**, **mining**, **staking** and any other topic where you want to get more clarification. Is there no search? Search by hand.

Don't be scared if you don't understand anything right away - crypto documentation is usually developer-oriented. Many of the pages will have lines of code. Forget the code, read what is written just before and after. It is usually the most potable written code.

Another document to look for on a crypto site is the **white paper**: search for a section related to *tokenomics*. Look for a **blockchain explorer** of that crypto. Is it an ERC20 Token? Then go to Etherscan. Is it BEP20? Go to the Bscscan.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3b56i21v8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e1075169986e2ac80be1aac670270a6e07e52a

 

Here you can quickly check who are the largest holders of a particular token, you can even see it in a pie chart!

We have already said it: be careful if there are wallets that hold 90% of the tokens in circulation. But that's not always the case: it often happens that the wallet you see at the top of the list, the one that holds the majority of the token, is a Smart Contract, which is used for things like **staking**.

If your crypto is not an ERC20 token, hopefully their blockchain explorer will also allow you to see an exhaustive list of who holds the token. Don't they? RED FLAG.

Now that you have done a great research on the crypto you want to invest in, there is only one thing missing: to look for important updates of the project, whether they are coming, planned, or have already taken place.

DYOR.

## 5th Phase: News and the RoadMap

For the last part of your crypto search you will need three things: one **Roadmap**, for an **blog** and recent news .. I recommend, in this order: usually the news is a summary of what they write in the blog.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjqumn9w8e381.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad660b1e1bd2e0a3fcfc783c9206532287177ddf

&amp;#x200B;

 

Take advantage of the news you read in even small publications: they can come in handy if the blog post they refer to is too long or complicated to digest.

Let's talk now about RoadMap.

In my experience, cryptocurrency RoadMaps tend to be vague and don't provide the information we're actually looking for. Watching interviews with founders and CEOs will provide far more insight into the future of their project than its RoadMap. In a good crypto, you will find a nice roadmap that contains realistic goals, which can be achieved before the project runs out of funds or is destroyed by the competition. If you don't find any RoadMaps and if the interviews you've watched don't give you the feeling that the project will last a very long time‚Ä¶ maybe you're looking at the wrong investment.

The future is not all that matters: find out if they have achieved what they have promised to do to date .. and here comes the blog.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dhqnug4x8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4445225ef252d6b6f6f74c2673b2eeb86f44a16c)

If you're having a hard time finding a blog on a crypto's website, chances are you'll find it on their **Medium**. Other times you will have to go and browse theirs **GitHub** to see their progress .. from that you can really ask yourself if the project is progressing in the desired direction.

Browsing through the blog headlines of a crypto project is just more than enough to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhether it was true to its word and the direction it is headed. It's good to go then actually read the whole article if that update talks about significant updates like those related to changes in tokenomics or any announcement that talks about big *partnership*.

As a last resort, open a new tab and open some cryptocurrency news sites such as Cointelegraph, Coindesk or Decrypt and try to find some headlines dedicated to the project you are looking for. Can't find anything? That's not necessarily a bad sign as compared to traditional media, the crypto world media does things their own way, and they don't always like to tell big headlines about important things that happen.

At this point you should have all the information you need to make a good judgment that a cryptocurrency has real value and is tied by a legitimate project. If you don't have a good judgment of it, you are probably dealing with a project to watch out for, or even stay away from. It's bad to think about it, but it could also mean you'll have to go back, *back to the drawing board*, and check the resources you used in your research.

Researching crypto is a lot of work. But ask yourself: is a few hours of research worth it for a 100x return on your investment? ‚Ä¶ ..‚Ä¶ ..‚Ä¶ ..

DYOR.

## Conclusions

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Primo*: I go to coinmarketcap or coingecko to see if the token is actively trading, preferably on reliable exchanges. Is the coin dead or dying? I don't waste time.

*Second*: I go to Youtube and see what other people have said about the project, and take a few notes if it's worth it.

*Third*: check Messari and Binance research, to get a clearer idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat and what the project is and how it works. I keep taking notes, and I also start jotting down a few questions and the names of the founders.

*Room*: check Icodrops to see how much funds the project managed to raise and how the tokens were awarded. I use the sources that show together with Messari to double check that the details listed are correct.

*Fifth*: I go back to Youtube and watch all the interviews I can, among the most recent, made with the CEO or the founder of the project. Very often what they say answers many of the questions I wrote in the second passage: they also tend to clarify many components that I thought were confusing about the technology used. I am also looking for a Youtube channel of the crypto, and if it is present it often offers insights and additional explanations. Assuming that everything I discovered hasn't dampened my enthusiasm,

*Sixth*: dig into the project documentation. I look for any additional details to the technology used by that crypto, consensus mechanisms, tokenomics, staking rewards, mining requirements, and any other key components that I have learned so far.

*Seventh*: I sift through their RoadMap and blog to see if they have made the progress they promised and if they can realistically build and deliver whatever they need to move their project forward.

*Eighth*: check if their business has made headlines in the crypto space with big and exciting headlines in major crypto publishers. If there are no big headlines, watch out! Maybe we are in a critical moment of the project, and we got there before the others.

This strategy of mine for doing effective cryptocurrency research is certainly not bulletproof. But for me it is a perfect blend of observation, reading and repetition.

It is easy to forget that the world of cryptocurrencies is a very new field, much is still in its infancy. So, if you learn how to get good at doing your crypto research right now you will become one of the few people who really knows what's going on when FOMO hits a bullish market ... as it happened recently, on April 22, 2021, after the statements of the President Biden.

\-**Stop watching the money in your account go down**. Look at the price trajectory relative to the amount of time the asset has traded.

\-BTC at **40k as of September 3rd**...its now 3 months later **December 4th where its at 47.8k after** a big retracement...what are you concerned about exactly? You should be happy we are up 7-8k in just 3 months. My theory is just that the majority of people here are pretty young and lack the emotional maturity and the experience in the markets or investing in general to view things this way.

Anything over 0.02%, is overleveraged. If it gets above 0.03%, watch for whales to move in to drop the prices resulting in overleveraged traders liquidating. Then watch the whales re-enter to buy coins at a discount.

Check out this [link.](https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate) (Coinglass) to follow funding rates.

Funding rate for BTC was up to .033% yesterday and went down to -.011% overnight to around .003% at the time of this post. Keep in mind funding rate is not a predictor of price change. Its simply another metro worth looking at to better understand the market.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8kkwy,What would you sell to buy the dip?,"Given a chance that whatever you sell right now can be regained after a month. What would you be willing to sell to buy the dip? 

Being a student,I'm fine with my mobile, there goes my laptop, university fee , shitty grade cards on ebay. 

I'm all out of money and kind of jealous of people who've bought the dip. Though, I bought it when it was green. 
I wonder how much my balls would sell for.

And yes it's a shitpost because I'm from a third world country and every moon matters. Gonna buy the next dip",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8jnb2,This dip really helps for my tax season!!,"For those of you who are concerned about taxes this year, this dip is really good. If you are in red numbers right now, in any coin, do your numbers!! When in red if you sell you will generate a taxable event and have a Loss. This loss, if you are in an exchange, will be tax deductible (if not in an exchange is the same, but harder to demonstrate). 
Since the IRS does not consider crypto assets as securities/stocks, these are not subject too the Wash-Sale Rule, so basically you can sell at loss and buy 1 minute later, only loosing the transaction fee, but wining the tax deduction. 

By the way this is absolutely legal.

t3_r8l0oq,Who's to blame? Who benefits the most?,"For everyone who loves the color Red, this must be a great way to wake up. 

I guess we are all trying to figure out who is to blame for this crash? Why did it happen just when Europe was sound asleep, right when the weekend started, and when most Americans were about to go to bed...? 

It almost seems too well coordinated to be just a coincidence. I understand the house of cards idea, but something must have planned this... 

In order to find out who did it, I guess we have to start looking at who benefits the most? 


- A group of Whales? I can imagine that Whales live in the same crypto tax havens or are at least in touch with one another. Why compete with one another if you can coordinate to make more profit? --but is this enough of get a crash like this?


- Banks? Crypto is a major threat to the banking world. I think it is silly to believe they haven't already invested heavily into crypto themselves, which makes it easier for them to manipulate the market to A) make a lot of profit, B) discourage people into buying Crypto with crashes like this, C) to send a strong message to the influential people ( politicians, celebrities, but also news papers), and D) to encourage more restrictions and regulations on Crypto. 


- Stock Market? See arguments for Banks, I guess... if they are not one and the same. 


- Governments? I haven't heard of any new restriction/regulation in the past 6 hours, so this one seems unkikely. 


- Omicron - if it would cause it dip, then we already had it. 


- Political tension? Russia near the Ukranian border? I don't think we'll see any effect until they decide to invade early 2022. 


- .... any suggestions?",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8he3j,"Whenever the Crypto Market dips, people try to connect it with the latest news. But its always manipulators doing their thing!","I have seen this one too many times. I get it. People put their life savings in crypto, they are always watching the news, Youtube videos and reading articles about it.

When the market dips, fear comes around. Viewers retention rises on youtube, articles get read alot and people put on the news more often.

Though these YouTubers, reporters dont know any better than you do.

They always connect the crash with recent bad news. 

Now they are connecting this crash to Stock market crash. 
2 days ago it was the new COVID variant.

6 days ago it was Indian government.

A month ago it was Evergrande.

In may it was Elon Musk. 


We have to realise, crypto sure is volatile, but is not as unstable as we think it is. It always requires manipulators to make crypto so volatile. 

When the big guns want to get in on Crypto, they use the manipulators to bring the price down.
Paid news articles follow the course. 

They get in at low prices.

Market rises, keeps heading up. When their stomach is full, they pay news articles to write about how crypto will keep heading high. How certain coins will 100x, 1000x from here onwards. New investors fall prey to that, and that is when these greedy rich people sell.

My advice to myself is, do not believe the news or a Youtuber. Follow your instict. Get in with what you can lose, and get out when its enough.

I hope all these pumpers took their profits in a timely fashion.

As always the market reverts to the mean. Reversal is most prominent in crypto as many coins never recover at all after their one time wonder pump. 

Majority of the coins that were taking turns to pump were in reality just a few whales doing their pump cycle from one coin to another.. but oh no, you could never even mention the truth to the circlejerk going on here that their shitcoin wasnt going to change the world, and rather its just a pump and dump game, otherwise all of them would attack you with their pitchforks.

t3_r8k9kf,Evergrande - you bastard! You gonna make me ask the group,"With the massive dip caused by ""Evergrande"", it has made it very confusing which coins to buy. 
Too many options and not enough fiat. 
What is the best deal to buy now??

I admit, I got scared the first go round a couple of months ago when CNBC and Bloomberg wouldn't stop taking about Evergrande and their $300 billion debt that would be the blame for a major worldwide collapse. Yes, the FUD got me to sell all my meta plays before Zuckerberg caused them all to shoot up especially MANA which didn't move for like 7 months. URGH!!

t3_r7tm7s,Crypto.com Marketing Spend,"I work in advertising sales at one of the largest media &amp;amp; entertainment companies on the planet. We closed a 1-year deal this week with CRO. Without sharing the exact number, I will say that their marketing spend is the single largest 1-year deal I‚Äôve ever worked on in my 8-year career working with 400+ domestic &amp;amp; international advertisers. Their campaign kicks off next week &amp;amp; runs thru 2022 on National TV, digital, etc. If they‚Äôre spending this much on our networks, that means they‚Äôre likely spending just as much with the other major media networks/companies/platforms. Factor that in with their [former] Staples Center arena naming deal and their partnerships with UFC, Formula One, etc.. and you‚Äôve got one of the largest marketing spends in recent history. I would not be surprised if they break some type of record for 1-year media spends. If Crypto.com isn‚Äôt already household name, I am absolutely certain that the size of their 2022 marketing campaign will make them one early next year. As the crypto space continues to trend upward in terms of mainstream adaption, my only hope is that casual first-time crypto investors will turn to Crypto.com if they want to dip their toes in the crypto space. They‚Äôre literally gonna see their ads everywhere. It‚Äôll be natural. I‚Äôm not sure what that‚Äôll do to the price/value of CRO (I‚Äôm no crypto expert) but I‚Äôd like to think their marketing efforts will yield positive results.

This is literally my first post ever. Just figured I‚Äôd share some info I think may be somewhat valuable to the community. Everyone knows crypto.com has spent a lot to get their name out there, but I don‚Äôt think most people really know how much.

And it even makes sense in the large picture because there's not enough money for everyone to become millionaire, but there is enough money for some to become billionaires.

Yesterday  everybody was expecting a pump at 53k and llok what happened.

If you ever see a prediction trending in socials where everybody agrees, my advice would be to bet against that prediction.

Not financial advice of course.

I don't understand, is this some moon farming thing like with the liquidations ? Like when the market is down you gotta make things seem even worse? 

I just added to my stack and am confident we'll recover super soon. I don't get what the panic is about. And I don't get people feeding it.

I do not know about technical analysis, but I know that it does not give a shit about cryptocurrencies.

However, looking at the charts I think that what was supposed to be has already happened and some cryptos are slowly bouncing back and in a while everything will start to grow again.

Let's see if you are one of those people who are afraid or you are also optimistic?

The most important thing is the attitude, after all, each of us believes in the future of cryptocurrencies and claims that DCA, that he holds firm, that after all, fuck FIAT, inflation, governments. So why all the panic? What are you afraid of man, hold firm to your beliefs.

t3_r8sjxu,Never have more in Crypto then you can afford to lose.,"I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for years. Every price increase is followed with FOMO and people wondering if they are ‚Äútoo late‚Äù. Every crash and people are freaking out. 

We don‚Äôt talk enough about actual sound investment strategies. Not just buy high and sell low. But you should never have more in crypto then you can afford to lose. 

Crypto is not a retirement plan. It is not a savings account. This is high risk speculation. Crypto is somewhere between a drunk night at a casino and a lottery ticket. Yes, you can make money. Yes, you can lose money in more stable investments. But in terms of absolute risk you should not be investing money into crypto if you need that money for real life expenses. 

Every investment, crypto or not, should have an exit plan. Whenever you make a purchase you need to decide how long your holding that asset, and when your exiting. That exit includes a loss and a gain. If your portfolio is worth more then you can stomach to lose, cash out. There is nothing wrong with walking away with realized gains. You can not hem and haw about ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù You need to make that exit strategy at purchase, not crash. 

Also, remember that until you cash out you haven‚Äôt lost or gained anything. Just because your portfolio is worth seven figures one day and four the next doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve lost anything. It just means the value of what you hold is less. If you think it‚Äôs going to go back up and can afford to keep the money put stop looking at your account and find a new hobby for a while.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8sh0s,Timing the market is just as important as recurring buys - both is the way to go.,"Just 8 hours ago, the market was down 20%, some of my coins were down almost 25% from yesterday (CRO for example) 

I normally have my recurring weekly buys do the work for me, but I wouldve lost out on 10% lower buys than I would if I waited until now. Buy timing the market I've managed to lower my AVG buy from a few of my coins. 

If I'd of left it to the recurring buy, this wouldn't of happened. I know people here like to say time in the market is better than timing, but when you're able to lower your AVG cost it's always a good idea to do so. Especially when the coin is massively under its ATH (unless it's ICP) 

Treat your DCA like you treat your HODL and forget about it, sure. But always have extra funds to buy more coins when the market drops this low. 

""What if it drops more tomorrow"" obviously buy more. Don't go broke on buying huge amounts, but definitely continue to buy more as it goes down, the more you buy and the lower it goes the cheaper your AVG cost per coin will be.

t3_r8o500,Now is the time to buy or harvest some losses,"With the market crashing this morning, now is a good time to buy in at a lower price (compared to previous prices) or reduce your taxes via tax-loss harvesting.

And tax-loss harvesting could be a useful strategy right now if you've managed to make significant gains through this bull run.

Now, I'm no expert on tax-loss harvesting but I will share a short excerpt of [this guide](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-tax-loss-harvesting/) as a kinda TLDR:

# What is it?

&gt; Tax-loss harvesting is an investment strategy that helps reduce your net capital gains and, in turn, reduces your tax bill for the financial year.

# How does it work?

&gt; If you make a capital gain *(profit on your crypto when you sell)*, you‚Äôll pay Capital Gains Tax on the profit from your disposal. If you make a capital loss, you don‚Äôt pay tax on it.

&gt; When you file your taxes as part of your annual tax return - you‚Äôll report both your net capital gain and net capital loss. You subtract your net capital loss from your net capital gain and the amount left is the amount you‚Äôll pay Capital Gains Tax on.

&gt; Crypto tax loss harvesting is when an investor sells crypto at a loss to create a capital loss to offset it against their capital gains and reduce their overall tax bill.

# In a nutshell (true TLDR):

Sell some of your cryptos now to create a capital loss to offset the gains you may have made throughout the year and you, therefore, pay fewer taxes.

# Note:

This is the basics of it and a lot of the rules around it will vary from country to country. 

So, if you're looking to use this strategy I recommend you check [the guide](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-tax-loss-harvesting/) I linked above as they cover some nuances in the rules of how to do this and go into much more detail than I did.

A harsh reality: Just because the crypto market spent last December-April personally sucking every holders‚Äô dick, it does not mean that will happen again this year.

Why?: Because giant pumps are fueled by new money entering the market. Without either A) massive fucking retail hype, or B) massive fucking institutional hype, that won‚Äôt happen.

What happens in the meantime?: Shit is boring or depressing. Weak hands get shaken out of their coins by whales, who buy that shit up at a discount until the next hype cycle.

Moon when?: When shit gets hype enough again that whales take a step back from price control because they feel a massive influx of new money will arrive.

If you need to see where we left off with the latest update, check here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r63us8/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_midweek_6_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

If you're not familiar with the project, 6 weeks ago I started a 1 year experiment where I am investing in alt-coins using a slightly modified DCA approach. Bottom line is each of the 16 coins in the project (plus 3 coins I chose as controls) gets a $25 buy once every 4 weeks. Each coin was suggested by someone in the sub and in the end I will donate some money from the winning coin to a charity of their choosing.

After my midweek update, things started to pick up. By Thursday I was looking great, portfolio up ~7%, LUNA, MATIC, AVAX, CRO and EGLD were all jockeying for position and at various points throughout the week, all 5 of those had been the highest percentage gainer in the portfolio. Well, I don't know if any of you noticed, but Friday was not a great day for either the stock market or crypto. Before I went to bed on Friday night I took a quick glance and I was down around 20%.

When I woke up Saturday morning it appeared that the downward spiral at least was stopped. My portfolio had ""recovered"" somewhat to ""only"" be down ~15%. I took a few minutes to evaluate my thoughts on this. Yes there was some scary market news and some bad news for the crypto market in general, but did my overall thesis change? Well, for me, the answer is no. I still believe that crypto is the future. So I decided to take action.

I quickly moved to position new moneys onto the various exchanges I am using for the experiment (CoinBase, Binance.us, Crypto.com, BlockFi and KuCoin for anyone wondering) and made a 1 time buy of $25 for every one of the coins in the project. Less than an hour later, nearly every one of those purchases is net positive. Time will tell if that holds true or if we see a further dip.

I wanted to post this update prior to my full update later today because I see a lot of discussion on here about whether now is the right time to buy/sell/hold onto what you've got. I'm lucky in that I'm in a position where I have not invested more than I can afford to lose and I am able to look at my position and decide that this is the right course of action for me.

If you are in a similar position to me and you believe in the future in this space, now may be a good time to do like I did and make a one-time purchase at what appear to be discounted rates. If this dip made you realize that you really can't afford to lose the money you've got invested in the crypto space though, maybe this is an opportunity to rethink your holdings and move some into safer investments (responsibly of course, please don't panic sell). Everyone's risk profile and approach will be different, but ultimately it's a very personal decision we all have to make. Don't feel bad about making a well thought out decision that is right for your financial situation.

As for the project, I wanted to post this update because this was outside of the established framework I had for the project and while I did it in what I think is a very fair way (even purchases of all coins in the experiment) I wanted to provide an update to those who have been following along. I don't have time to compile all the data regarding individual pricing right now, but I will provide that either later today or tomorrow when I have more time. As always if you're curious about where the various holdings sit and which coins are on top, you can check out the portfolio on CoinGecko using this link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment

As of the time I'm making this post, the portfolio balance is $1,246.57 for a total loss so far of $78.28 (-5.91%). You can use this to guesstimate total value in each coin currently. Keep in mind that EGLD, VET, ATOM and XTZ are the 4 coins in group A which will be purchased again next week, so they each only have $50 invested at this point whereas all of the other coins in the project now sit at $75.",CryptoCurrency

Yeah occasionally we'll see a 7% pullback which let's be honest is more ""cute"" than ""scary"" and people will talk about nows the time to buy the dip and if you're not ready for the downs you don't deserve the ups.

While we've not yet seen what I would call a crash, we're getting into the territory where a lot of people in this subs dicks are shrinking and their buttholes are puckering. Were not yet in the territory of posting suicide hotline numbers but if Bitcoin dips below 40k which is a real possibility, my bottom prediction is just under 38k, we're really going to see a separation of the men from the boys. 

I think this is also a lesson to take profits and keep some cash on the sidelines. When things are going up it seems like it's never going to stop and when things are falling it seems like they're never going to come back. This is the pullback people at least have been saying they've been waiting for, but the reality is most people will be too scared to take advantage of it.

Head over to a sub like r/stocks and you can see the panic over there. Only thing is their market is closed so they have to bite their finger nails until Monday mornning to see what's going to happen. Now that crypto has more mainstream involvement and institutional involvement can crypto prices and/or crashes be the canary in the coal mine of what's to come for stocks on Monday?

There's no rewards for being in crypto for a long time and there's no seniority bonuses. I saw a post of someone the other day who was upset because they'd been in crypto for years and  years recently got a friend into it who did well off some meme coins and while the friend was a butthole sanchez for rubbing it in their face, especially considering she was the one who got her friend into crypto, it shows there's no bonuses or rewards for having known about or bought into crypto early on, if you bought bitcoin at 40k rode it to 60k and then it crashes back to 40k you have nothing to show for your money if you didn't take some profits along the way. 

I guess what I'm saying is this, sack up boys, if this is too much for you take your money out of your Coinbase or Crypto.Com account and go start dollar cost averaging into VTI. If that's not you take this as an opportunity to re-evaluate your positions, setup a new DCA strategy and keep on trucking.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8b8ms,Roughly $420 Million dollars in longs in mostly BTC and ETH were liquidated in around 15 minutes. With other longs in coins totalling around another $400M.,"Kind of an interesting development that prices only dropped a couple percentage points and a shit load of overleveraged longs just took a massive dump.

BTC is down around %6 
and ETH is down just about 7.5%

It's interesting to note a large amount of options contracts are expiring at the end of this month, and I'm somewhat curious if there's a large push to hold prices down in the short term to avoid some bad contracts and punish overleveraged positions.

Everyone was saying it was because of ""Omicron"" but that's highly doubtful considering that news broke more than a week ago.

I find it odd that the random daily pumps and dumps of $3k up and down caused no liquidations really either way, but this relatively mild percentage drop actually had a fairly large impact.

t3_r82ows,After the Badger Dao hack everyone should get in the practice of revoking smart contract access on their wallets once their initial use is complete.,"Badger Dao was hit almost 2 days ago.  From what I understand It was done by breaking into the creators cloudflare account and dropping malicious code onto their site header.  It then had the users agree to a malicious contract and drained their wallets.

While not all smart contracts are malicious, duh, there are risks that come with signing these contracts with the ability to TransferFrom your account.  Once agreeing to said contract there money can be pulled from that account without further approval. This means 2fa and ledger will not protect you if the contract is malicious.  These contracts have you agree to a set limit up to infinite.  When agreeing to them you are often able to edit them and see what it is asking for.  Some protocols will allow you to change the set amount on the contract, but not all.

Staking and wrapping contracts can be examples of these contracts with transfer from ability.  They are popular on OHM forks.

When it comes to rebasing in an OHM fork protocol like these you should not need to keep the smart contract access to your accounts active to continue receiving said rebases.  I have tested this with multiple account on Wonderland and am still receiving rebases on my wrapped memo.

It doesn't matter how much faith or trust or whatever you have in a protocol or it's owners.  There are still risks involved.  Check your approved contracts every time you log out of your wallet just to be sure.  There's no reason to leave a contract with such abilities just sitting open on your account after the initial use.  

Tip: connecting a wallet is different than signing a contract.  Said contract will require a transaction fee and be visible on the chain.  Connecting a wallet simply allows a site to see you address and give you information relevant to it.

Do yourself a favor and use a token allowance tracker to see what contracts are currently approved.  Revoke access to anything that has completed it's use.   Revoking access essentially approves a 0 spend limit.  This will cost you a transaction fee. When you need to move the money around again the protocol will ask you to sign the contract once more.

There are plenty of token allowance trackers.  Make sure to use one that works with the chains you have contracts on.  Snowtrace has one for Avalanche.  DeBank has one for quite a few chains.  Use one you trust.

If you would like more info on this here is a good medium article on the TransferFrom issue with these defi 2.0 sites.  

https://brogna.medium.com/token-allowance-dc553f7d38b3

If everyone in the BadgerDAO was in the practice of checking approved contracts after they were done working with their crypto the vast majority of users would have been safe.  They would have seen a third contract and been able to identify it as malicious.  This script was injected on Nov 10.  The scammers waited until critical mass before draining.  If the users had checked their contracts and removed them after using the site then said contracts would not have had approval to move any of their money when the actual drain hit.  It's just good practices.

Good luck out there everyone.  It's fucking scary these days.  It's the wild west.  Be safe.

t3_r8qitd,A solution to the 5$ wrench attack?,"  

Many people wonder about the best way to secure their cryptos. Whether it is to protect themselves from a hack, in case of loss or forget your seed, or even to protect yourself from the famous $5 wrench attack. The use of the Metamask and Ledger combo allows to have an excellent protection but it is possible to go even further with the multisig, that I discovered thanks to Gnosis Safe. 

*I promise you I‚Äôm not paid but I just wanted to share something I discovered recently and wanted to talk about something I know and use so don‚Äôt hate me for repeating a thousand times ‚ÄúGnosis Safe‚Äù.*

Gnosis Safe allows the creation of a portfolio via a smart contract and thus the implementation of a better security thanks to multi-signatures. This ensures that the smart contract is not controlled by a single recovery phrase or person, which means that the security of the portfolio can be spread over multiple devices. 

This means that even if one of your wallets gets hacked, lost or stolen, no transactions can be made. I can't guarantee your physical integrity or good health if you get kidnapped to give up your cryptos but at least your money will be safe.

Multisig, via Gnosis for example (there are undoubtedly several apps doing the same thing), ensures that digital assets are effectively protected while retaining agility and the ability to transact on multiple blockchains. Multisig requires that a predefined number of people or devices (such as multiple Ledgers you own) approve a transaction, preventing unauthorized access and loss of tokens. 

Side note: make sure that the people or devices that need to sign your transactions don't know each other or are not in the same place, this will prevent you from getting robbed by your family if ever, just my personal advice ;)

Moreover Gnosis Safe is compatible with almost all dApps on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum and some others, you can also use Wallectconnect, manage your NFTs, etc. so it‚Äôs pretty easy to work with this one.

Note that gas fees will be deducted when the last person validates the transaction, if the transaction is not validated, no fees will be applied.

So on Gnosis Safe it is possible to:

* Configure a multisig wallet
* Add the addresses of the portfolios whose signature is required
* Define the minimum number of signatures required, for example 2 out of 3, if one or more people/devices are not available
* Deposit tokens on the smart contract address
* Define a limit below which multi-signature will not be required
* Define a limit beyond which more signatures will be required
* Track your transactions
* And finally track the assets available on the multisig portfolio 
* Bonus: you can now sleep peacefully",CryptoCurrency

In the USA they have active waitlists for both the desktop version and debit card currently available to sign up for.

I mainly use Crypto.com's debit card for now but Crypto.com doesn't have their exchange launched in the US yet.

If you didnt YOLO in at ATHs over the last month, chances are you are probably up 100s of percent this year... I dont see the point in bearish selling if this is the case, as you should still be super flush RN.. so my thoughts are this- People are taking profit or removing their original investment to play with house money... 

  This is what Im thinking because over the last month at ATHs thats what I was doing myself... I have already taken out what I put in this year, and my accounts are still very green even if I hadnt... So I think people are probably taking profits out to buy lambos and holiday gifts, some people are probably also selling before the new year for tax reasons depending on where they live... I think these sales have led to some bearish selling and this has pushed it lower..

Im wondering if this is a bear trap in the making, The way I see it people are probably cashing in for the holidays, and are likely to start trading again more after the holidays/new year after showing their relatives the sweet rented lambo and semi expensive wine they bought with their profits.. 
  I may be a fool (trust me I am) but I suspect this isnt bearish selling as much as it is profit taking for the holidays and tax reasons...

For example BTC surveys values your BTC in points with one point = 0.01$ USD worth of BTC rather than the amount of BTC you actually have earned, where as Rollercoin shows you how much BTC you have earned and stockpiled. 

This makes me think about how with these crypto faucets, would it potentially be a good idea to gain some side crypto through them, and then cash out when the prices are lower so you get more bang for your buck? It also makes me wonder how sustainable these faucets are if the prices are so voaltilie?

t3_r8upce,Enter the Casino - which coin will explode when the smoke clears?,"Hello crypto fam!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but today's dip/correction/crash is going to find its bottom eventually. Whether it's the beginning of a bear or crab market, or the calm before the bull market storm of lore, it's fair to assume that SOME coins will recover substantially from whatever lows they stabilize at. I'm interested to see which coins r/cc fam thinks will rebound most substantially in a short period of time. This doesn't have to mean a damn thing about the utility of the coin - I'm wondering about pure (speculative) increase in value relative to wherever we bottom out. I'm sure there are plenty of data you can use to support your claim, but whatever the case - which coin do you think can generate the most substantial ROI in a short period of time?",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8upbt,Are We Here? BTC 2013 Analysis,"Here is some analysis for you, during this difficult period, to provide some perspective and hope (ium?). :)

An explanation of the chart:

1. This is the weekly BTC-USD log chart. In it you can see BTC adhering to a very clear channel on the weekly timeframe, with clear points of resistance and support at the top, middle and bottom of the channel. A touch of the top usually means immediate pullback and entering of the ""bear-market"", if you want to use that term. However the midpoint in this channel is our focus. I have highlighted with a green dot every time Bitcoin broke this midpoint of resistance/support, or held it as support. I have marked with a red dot every time it met resistance and failed to break, or failed to hold it as support.
2. If we look at April 2013, BTC came up to this midpoint, tested it, failed to break, and retraced, holding the 50 EMA on the weekly as support, retested the midpoint and broke through. This breakout initiated a very strong upsurge, ending in new ATHs, and the end of that bull run.
3. Today: From Feb-May of this year, BTC tested this midpoint multiple times, failed to break through and retraced, similar to the April period of 2013. It has now held the 50 EMA as support twice, and at the moment we are seeing a third test of it, hopefully for support.

Will this retest of the 50 EMA on the weekly as support initiate BTC's final surge of this bull-market, through this resistance, and on to ATHs into late January or even February of 2022?

Here's hoping.

Now I just wish that I had invested that money on something else, or just sell when it peaked.
Fast forward to this day, still the same thing's going around. just buy &amp; hodl bro, buy &amp; hodl. I just realized that the mentality here is that to convince newcomers to buy more crypto whenever they can - disregarding the whole market situation at that time. and that is a horrible advice to be honest. If you are a newbie here and want some advice:

1. stay away from here unless you are here for the memes
2. only put in what u can afford to lose
3. only enter when all the crypto's are at or near the all time lows, so just wait for the right time and make your move
4. buy &amp; hodl is a myth so sell when it reaches your target. don't be greedy
5. if you don't know jack shit about graphs &amp;amp;amp; charts like me, follow advices of crypto analysts. believe me, they give thousand times better advices than here

Estimates of the amount of the loss seem to be in the $130 million range. The way that this happened was that the attacker was able to inject a script into the Badger front-end, and many users wound up accidentally granting spending permission to the attacker's address. It's a mistake that could happen to any of us.

&amp;#x200B;

The folks at the Badger DAO discord have published a list of addresses that are still at risk. These are addresses for which it would be advisable to revoke spending permission to the attacker's address. Assuming that it's ok to put a link to a google doc here, if your address is on the following list, you're probably at risk: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10EouKIXBZnDTtgXEMP8YGwcWMf92KwixUVrclSGk520/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10EouKIXBZnDTtgXEMP8YGwcWMf92KwixUVrclSGk520/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're at risk and want to revoke permission, there are websites such as [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) and [debank.com](https://debank.com) that have tools for revoking permission. The attacker's known address is 0x1fcdb04d0c5364fbd92c73ca8af9baa72c269107. If you have a spending allowance for that address, you'll want to revoke it by setting it to 0.

Flash crash in september with Evergrande FUD going on? Time to paper hand once more. Sell everything again. No reaction on the market when evergrande misses their second payment, things start to breaking bearish pattern in TA - buy back ~ 12% profit

Paper handed at ~59k after it failed to pass 60k for the second time. Haven‚Äôt bought back yet. Will still wait a day or two. At this point it would give me ~20% profit.

Bitcoin (BTC) sellers were active on Friday, pushing the cryptocurrency toward the bottom of its weeklong price range. Lower support at about $53,000 could stabilize the current pullback.
BTC was trading at around $55,000 at press time and is down about 2% over the past 24 hours.
Upside momentum is starting to slow on the daily and weekly price charts, which means upside could be limited toward $60,000 resistance. For now, the intermediate-term uptrend remains intact given the upward sloping 100-day moving average.

It's been another week of high volatility for the broader cryptocurrency market. After intense sell-offs driven by concerns related to regulatory threats and the emergence of the coronavirus omicron variant, many leading cryptocurrencies have posted strong gains over the last seven days of trading. 

The tokens of Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), Cardano (CRYPTO:ADA), and Solana (CRYPTO:SOL) are up roughly 6.5, 3.5%, and 12.6%, respectively, over the past week as of 2:30 p.m. ET today. Resurgent bullish momentum in the crypto space after its recent volatility appears to be the biggest catalyst behind each token's gains in the past seven days, but there are also some coin-specific factors that are likely influencing the increases. 

Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano's respective tokens each differ from some other major cryptocurrencies in the sense that they're tied to application-building networks, as opposed to just functioning as currencies. It's possible that this may give them a superior fundamental valuation case compared with tokens like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Investors have been keeping a particularly close eye on how application-backed cryptocurrencies are performing relative to Bitcoin, and some are betting that a major shift could be in the works. 

With a current market capitalization of roughly $516 billion, Ethereum's ether token ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. For comparison, Bitcoin has a market cap of roughly",CryptoCurrency

BTC

ALGO

ONE

Since ONEs aren't on Kraken, I instead bought ADA.

I was going initially for a small DCA at $50 with $10 on each coins a week for at least 3 month, but the the dip happened and I was facing a choice: going on with the plan or try to buy as much of the dip possible.

I went with buy the DIP and invested as follow:

23.5 ALGO

t3_r89tyf,In the past 24 hours ~142k traders got liquidated for around ~800m dollars,"Today was a big flush of long positions and some short-traders positions. The total crypto space got 'rekt' for \~800m dollars in the past 24hours.

\- BTC is liquidated for \~300M dollar in regard to the total \~800M dollars.

\- The biggest liquidation was one trader losing $11.12m on DOT.

\- BTC traders lost the most cash in 24h, but ETH the past hour with \~30M liquidations compared to \~10M BTC.

What does this mean for the crypto space? Not much yet... While these numbers seem big, this flush out does not guarantee a price pump... but could be:

* On 26 October we had a slightly higher liquidation at \~900M dollars, this did not result in a direct price pump. However, we did see a new all-time at the starting days of November.
* We also saw a huge liquidation of \~3.5B dollars on 6 September. While this didn't cause BTC's price to rise directly, it did pump end of November and onwards in October (around the 19th).

But on the other hand:

* 15 November and 25 November have shown similar liquidations as happened today. Many speculators thought these two events would cause us to climb back, but this did not happen. Now we got our third liquidation in the same month.

What this all means? I honestly don't know. Positive macro indicators and flush outs of overleveraged people often mean a short term rise after the price. Hence, the calls of many analysts that this was the 'bottom' or 'last dip before the pump'.

It's very scary to say now: 'Okay this really was the true bottom', because that has pranked us all these last weeks.

Personally, I think the 100MA support around \~51k is the bottom and that these three liquidations were enough to see healthy growth in price again as we saw after the liquidations in September.

I‚Äôve heard people just get a recommendation from a coworker at their jobs or some people just by chance glanced at an advertisement and changed their lives forever.

Personally my dad had a client a few years ago who was very enthusiastic about Ethereum and that snowballed into me hearing about it and becoming interested. Despite my dad loving everything to do with Ethereum I was more interested in Cardano and so put all of my savings from my part time job into it and of course now I am a very happy man.

Secondly, why are you still involved in crypto? Obviously monetary incentives are the main reason but why else? Is it the technical side or is it the politics of it?(A big middle finger to the establishment). For me I‚Äôm still here for the financial know how.

t3_r8o6gt,What happened? Spoofing happened,"Edit: source is Willy Woo

I know we can all state the obvious that macro is a big reason for the decline since yesterday morning when BTC was 57k. From JPOW/Tapering, to evergrande, to omicron you name it. The macro environment played a role but this flash crash to 40k can be explained with spoofing. 

In laymen terms, Spoofing is a market manipulation strategy that is considered illegal in the United States but since we don‚Äôt really have regulation it‚Äôs easier to implement with crypto (even though it‚Äôs still illegal).

Spoofers create a fake demand and supply of assets whereby they make a massive amount of limit orders on one side of the market to make it seem that is where the market will head too. With Spoofers bidding/limit orders, they actually intend to cancel it with the intent of making a hefty profit. 

Exchanges don‚Äôt have much protection against this and I can‚Äôt answer why (maybe they benefit?) that is especially when BitMEX founders were arrested because spoofing was common on that exchange. 

This happened to BTC at the end of November when we saw a bit of a rebound and Spoofers set limit orders below that level and then pulled out and set the price above the rebound. Hence now we are here hoping we can recover, hoping for 50k at EOD to keep things really bullish.",CryptoCurrency

###Conclusion

You want more and better porn, right?

1. These coins/platforms allow for anonymity
2. These coins/platforms allow for security
3. When performers are safer and compensated, they'll make more content

t3_r8lh9f,Welcome to the Casino. üé∞,"(A bullish casino)

As you can tell, we just experienced a substantial drop. Many coins averaging 25-30% in about 1 hour. BTC down $15K in 24 hours and about $9K in the big one hour drop. 

Analysts such as Plan B had estimates for BTC 100K by the end of November. Many predicted 100K by the end of year. As we could see by tonight. ANYTHING could happen, and we could see a huge upswing. I‚Äôm not going to put end of year predictions down at all. We still have more than 25 days left, anything could happen. This is the casino after all.

The reason I‚Äôm mentioning analytics is because in the end of the day, NOBODY knows.

t3_r7n8yd,Tax Tidbits From a CPA (US),"Without doxxing myself, I've been a CPA (specifically,  a tax accountant) in the US for about 10 years.  Recently at my firm, I've been included in a small group of professionals forming a network of crypto tax consultants and specialists.  As I truly love the crypto community, the best contribution to this sub I can think of is to try to 1) put together a few tax tidbits and 2) to answer every tax question that I can in the comments.  Reading alot of comments and posts in the sub, I'm a bit concerned that my fellow crypto enthusiasts are going to put themselves at risk of the IRS by not fully understanding the extent of their activities.  Now before I start answering, I'll add that anything I say should be used as a guide to either do further research on your own to understand your tax situation as it relates to crypto, or to acknowledge that your tax situation may be over your head and you should seek out a tax professional.  There are tax resources such as koinly, and while I don't use them personally,  I believe they are worth the investment - but I also want people to understand their own tax situation to make sure any paid service is handling your situation correctly. 

Without further adieu,  here are a few items of general knowledge and feel free to ask questions below and I'll try to answer everything (I'm operating under the assumption this post will generate probably 25 comments, so if for some reason it blows up, be patient and I'll try to get to everything). This will also be entirely US specific, anyone outside of the US, I'm sorry but I'm in no position to give tax opinions.

1) Your exchange, wallet, etc will likely not issue you a 1099-B for your trading activity, so don't count on getting any help from them, other than your transaction details. This won't be required for a few years and was part of the infrastructure bill.

2) Every crypto you swap, exchange, convert, sell, earn lending/bonding reward, mine, earn staking rewards, receive airdrops on is a taxable event in the current year. 

3) To emphasize the point above, this includes MOONS. Yes, all of those MOONS you receive via karma distribution should be picked up on your tax return. Same as BAT rewards by using Brave.

4) The value you pick up on any rewards, mining, staking, airdrops, faucets is the fair market value at the time of receipt. You should be tracking this on your own or using a service. 

5) The amount you pick up into income is now your basis. Basis is ""cost"".

6) Mining is considered self-employment income and should be reported on Schedule C, which differs from staking which would be picked up as other income,  along with the other items not including selling, swapping, exchanging.

7) Sending a crypto from one wallet or exchange to another is not a taxable event  - though you should track your transaction fees to include in your basis.

8) NFTs are treated the same way as everything above. 

9) Keep good records.  If you do not maintain good records or lose them and are not able to substantiate your cost basis, the IRS could make it $0, which would increase taxes you owe.

10) Holding period can give tax benefits. If you sell something you've held for a year, it's a long term capital gain and is taxed at preferential rates. Less than a year is at ordinary rates.

11) You are supposed to report the date purchased, date sold, cost, and sales proceeds of EVERY sell (exchange, sell, swap). Even if this results in $0 gain or loss.

12) Wash sale rules don't apply, however, selling something and immediately buying it back for tax loss harvesting could violate economic substance rules and on audit, the loss could be disallowed (it would likely be incorporated back into your basis).

13) Monero won't save you from paying taxes. Nor will boating accidents.

14) You can trade crypto using crypto/bitcoin IRAs and the gains are tax free,  but you can't pull out until retirement.  I don't utilize these services, but they exist. 

That's what I can think of for the time being, I'll make an edit if anything else important pops into my head.  I hope this and any questions provide some useful information to people in this sub. Best of luck to all!

TLDR: Taxes are hard, if you don't have your arms around it, seek a professional and bite the bullet and pay.  Feel free to ask tax questions below and I'll answer what I can.

Edit:

15) Earning rewards via a debit card like coinbase is NOT taxable.  It is considered a purchase discount.  You would have no income to report and your basis would be the value of the coin when received.

16) April 15th is a ways away, so you should use time now to start gathering all of your data.  If for some reason you can't get all of your data by 4/15, you can file a Form 4868 which will extend your tax due date to October 15th (you still have to pay all of your taxes you expect to owe by 4/15 - the 4868 just gives you time to finalize your return).

17) To expand on the mining bullet earlier,  as it's considered a business, you are able to take deductions against the mining income (equipment [bonus depreciation is your friend], electricity, other supplies). This will offset some of the tax impact especially in the early going.

18) If you had crypto gains you didn't report from Tax Year 2017 and earlier, it's likely those audit windows are closed, though some exceptions apply.

19) Staking presents unique challenges as sometimes rewards are earned by the minute.  There is no way to calculate income on this by the minute and I consider anything less than monthly to be an undue burden. For my personal taxes, I calculate income from staking rewards, like ALGO, monthly. I take my total rewards for the month and multiply them by a price from coinmarketcap around midnight.  I do this consistently with all of my coins and feel it's a reasonable and fair method. 

Lastly, this post blew up with questions, which is great because I'm happy knowing I'm helping alot of you. With that said, it's taking more time than I planned to get to everyone's question, especially with a wife and young kids - but I still plan on answering every questions on this thread, so if I haven't gotten to you yet, rest assured I will be in the next few days.

t3_r8jilc,How to survive the incoming(?)Bear Market,"1. **Do not PANIC SELL:** One of the biggest mistakes investors do in times like this is they start reacting emotionally rather than rationally.  Investors should try to always separate their emotions from the investment decision-making process. What seems like a massive global catastrophe one day may be remembered as nothing more than a blip on the radar screen a few years down the road. Remember that fear is an emotion that can cloud the rational judgment of a situation. 
2. **Analyze your Inventory:**  If you bought a bunch of shitcoins/meme coins, you just might be better off selling them. Your inventory must have at least 60% in BTC and ETH since they have proved time and time again their long-term resilience.
3. **Do not spend more than you can afford to lose:** Don't sell your house or do something rash. Yes, buying the dip is a good strategy but that doesn't mean you take several loans for the same.
4. **Take everything you read with a grain of salt** (Yes, even this post): Do not take someone else's word as gospel, do what you think is right(It is your money after all). This a time when scammers are especially active since they know that people are jumpy and emotional. Be wary of those DMs and people who say they can help you without asking/expecting anything in return.
5.  **Keep calm and HODL:** Don't get too hassled with this wild rollercoaster that we are experiencing. Buy the dip if you can otherwise cling to your assets and pray to Satoshi. A digital detox might do you some good if you have a habit of checking prices every 5 seconds.
6. **Dollar Cost Averaging:** The most important thing to keep in mind during an economic slowdown is that it's normal for the cryptoverse to have negative years‚Äîit's¬†part of the business cycle. If you are a long-term investor (meaning a time horizon of 10+ years), one option is to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging¬†(DCA). By purchasing shares regardless of price, you end up buying coins at a low price when the market is down. Over the long run, your cost will ""average down,"" leaving you with a better overall entry price for your coins.

t3_r86mqt,Why IOTA Will Evolve Cryptocurrency To Another Lever; Welcome Assembly,"First of all I have to say I was quite sceptical and to be honest confused when the annoucement came out and listened to the AMA in the hope to understand what was going on.

I have to say wow. This is HUGE and could very well make IOTA! This update is fundamentally required to the system.

To help others who are confused here are my notes. I have tried to structure them although the points weren't discussed in this order. I have sprinkled some of my own initial thoughts in.

Why Assembly?

Assembly is required to allow permissionless smart contracts. This cannot really be done on IOTA mainnet or Shimmer. Some people may not have realised this.

So for those that ask the main difference between the IOTA mainet and Assembly is permissioned v permissionless smart contracts. In ISCP, if someone wants to set up a smart contract chain they have to define who the validators are etc. In Assembly, you do not. Anyone can be a validator. Taking it back to IOTA's true original vision that we signed up for. A decentralised, free, trustless network.

Goverments (interesting that Dom specifically mentioned ‚ÄúGovernments‚Äù) and companies can still set up permissioned chains on ISCP if they want to. So not all smart contracts will run through Assembly. However, all Defi projects will be on Assembly.

Anyone can be a validator. Theoretically, people can run their own SC validator farms.

Finally, a key reason for using a new token and not just IOTA is the network‚Äôs reward and punishment structure for validators. For it to be decentralised, you have to incentivise validators to support and secure the network. To this the IF will have to mint new tokens to give as rewards and potentially to slash token benefits as a punishment to rogue/ bad validators. The IF realise the community will not accept lots of new IOTA being minted. Hence a new token is required.

Formation/ Structure of Assembly

More than a dozen venture capital and funders are involved and have pledged to invest in Assembly. These early investors will get 10% of Assembly tokens. They will be revealed soon. Although I see Hyperchain Capital on Twitter who also invested in Fantom are following Assembly and are tweeting about Assembly. Make of that what you will.

The IF chose the early investors very carefully. They had to believe in the system and help with BUIDL philosphy (i.e support the devs and dapps).

The VC and funders are bringing funds, devs and other dapps from other ecosystems. IF are are in talks with devs from other ecosystems and even more funders . But most of the dapps are likely to wait until mainnet to port over. This is likely exciting for funders as they can get in at ground zero.

Devs get access to 40% of the tokens. Dom stated this will be one of the biggest Dev funds in the space.¬†Current Devs won‚Äôt have to refactor their current work much and it will just be a reconfiguration change.¬†Which should be minor.

Dom was frank and stated that not having a premine¬†for IOTA has held it back a lot compared to other cryptos that have millions of dollars to sponsor F1 etc. The IF have only worked with donations and sponsorship and grants so far. The IF has earned its trusted reputation this way. But the IF wants to make as big impact as possible. With Assembly they can do a lot more and it is needed.¬†

I think they have approached this in a balanced way.

How Assembly will work

Assembly smart contract nodes will basically be WASP nodes (current smart contract nodes) with a few tweaks, so not much work do there for the IF.

Assembly is to run on IOTA not Shimmer, but it may happen in the future.

Assembly is 90% ISCP. So they are not reinventing the wheel with Assembly. This will save a lot of work and lead time.

Reception

IF has spoke with a lot of other major authorities in the space on this (Dom mentioned ETH community) a lot were really interested. Dom stated they wouldn't set up a separate network unless there was a real interest from partners and Devs on this. I think the new reward and punishment system for validators is key.

The IF is already speaking with two stable coin providers to support Assembly.

How does Assembly give IOTA value?

Assembly will be IOTA‚Äôs main source of adoption in the cryptosphere(Dom repeated this several times). Think of it as a major new use case. Your IOTA token is your key to the new decentralised network. Further, you need IOTA tokens to be a validator on Assembly. Validator gets rewards. This gives MIOTA even more value on top of any corporate adoption.

Updates on Assembly Progress so far

There has been one bridge built so far.

Assembly or Shimmer likely won't be released this year (""this year is almost over""). However, getting Shimmer and Assembly up and running is now IF's main focus. I think it will be Q1 2022. ¬†

""Assembly will probably launch on Chrysalis.""

You can already start building for Assembly now. IF providing support now. Will be ready for Assembly if it works on ISCP.

Tokenomics

Will provide more information on tokenomics next week.¬†

What sets Assembly apart

Permissionless smart contracts, with a free base layer. Amazing interoerability. It‚Äôs claim to fame will be flexibility. Anyone setting up can set a chain and define validation rules, fee and incentive structures. Validators can either accept or reject the request. This opens up the path for their to be 0 fee smart contracts.

You may ask why would Validators agree to this? Well, validators can be incentivised by receiving a separate token. Dom gave the example of a dex . It has its own token which it gives to validators in exchanges for doing SC for free. Great new strategies for businesses.

Tokens will be able to move freely and effortlessly between chains. Smart contract shards will be able to share resources.

Miner Extractable Value is not an issue on Assembly unlike some other SC protocols. This is huge as we already have the solution that many large SC protocols are struggling with.

Other Points not related to Assembly

IOTA FOUNDATION (IF) now have close to 200 people and still hiring a lot.¬†

IF are still not slowing down their corporate adoption arm. This will still continue and is a key focus. Zebra and Trademark East Africa has expanded a lot in the last month.¬†I am not too sure what this meant but sounded interesting.

TLDR: This is vital and huge in the next stage of IOTA.

In celebration of this milestone we are going to do a blockchain based giveaway with prizes of:

1. 5000 MOONs and special flair
2. 3000 MOONs
3. 2000 MOONs

These MOONs will be distributed by [u/TheMoonDistributor](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheMoonDistributor/), so they will carry voting weight in this subreddit's governance polls.

All  you need to do to participate in this giveaway is leave one top-level comment on this post that starts with a number between 0-1048575. After you write your guess for a number you can write whatever else you wish, but please put your number/guess first. For instance, your comment could  be:

&gt;42069 blablablabla

or

&gt;1337  
&gt;  
&gt;blabla  
&gt;  
&gt;blablabla

or just

&gt;420420

That's it, although there are two other rules:

1. You have to make your single guess/comment before 2021/12/06 23:59 UTC (that's just before midnight on Monday night UTC time)
2. Do **NOT** edit your comment at any point

The  winners will be selected based on whose guess is closest to the last  five characters of the hash of Bitcoin block #712948, which should occur  sometime on morning of Tuesday the 7th UTC time. For instance, the hash of block 712444 is:

&gt;0000000000000000000993242224e33c179bca1624799e8466d4ad53c2d8c265

So the last five characters are ""8c265"", which if we convert to decimal is  574,053. If there are multiple winners exactly as close we will award the full prize to both/all.

Good luck!",CryptoCurrency

If you are panicking right now because of this minor crash, you would have definitely panicked during all the minor flash crashes that happened in the past years too. You would not have been able to hold on to your BTC.

If you believe in BTC, ETH and other strong projects, dips and crashes are buying opportunities. Not the time to panic sell.

BTC and ETH have stood the test of time. They are here to stay. Longterm holding will bring your fortunes. Panic selling will drill a hole in your pocket.

t3_r8uppr,Influencers were predicting 100k BTC because that's what you wanted to hear,"I saw a lot of posts yesterday complaining about wild predictions not coming to fruition. Multiple crypto-influencers were predicting Bitcoin would be above 100k before the end of the year, and as it's not likely to happen after that nasty crash, some people are mad.

But here's the thing : **talking heads are making crazy predictions because it's what we, as a community, want to hear**.

We want to be comforted about our investment choices, so we only listen to the voices that are churning out bullish news and insane price targets. On the other hand, down-to-earth influencers, or those warning us crypto markets movements are famously hard to predict, are ignored, while those with rocket emojis in their YouTube thumbnails are racking up millions of views for their videos.

Here is the truth : when it comes to short-term prediction, **absolutely nobody has any clue about anything**. We can try to predict where the market is heading (I tried it myself a few times), but to give a precise target such as ""BTC 100k EOY!"" is just non-sense. You could end up being right, or entirely wrong.

That's why I try to stay away from all that noise. I choose solid projects, I DCA, I stake when possible and I relax. It's really not that complicated. I still keep small bags of various alts, just in case, but the bulk of my money is into ETH. Of course, I won't give you a price target today, but I am still certain that, in ten years, ETH will have more value then today.

So, here's my tip : get in with a strategy, and stick to it, while ignoring price predictions, TA and influencers. Long-term, you'll be happier, and possibly richer.",CryptoCurrency

It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC's market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:

1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. 

2.) The ""so called"" experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they're talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.

But during that time of January 2018 I really started to research Bitcoins history and technology and I really fell in love. Now this post wont be about the technology since we already have plenty talking about it but instead we'll talk about the history. Specifically the year 2014.

**When Shit Hits The Fan**
 
 - Mt Gox gets hacked

A lot of new people might not understand it but Mt Gox was the biggest Bitcoin Exchange at the time accounting for **70%** of all Bitcoin volume at the time. Imagine bigger than Coinbase and Binance combined. A lot of people lost everything and its hard to keep people motivated in the technology when they no longer have the thousands in it they once had. Even worse all their money belongs to a hacker now who will benefit the most from bitcoin adoption.

 - Bit License

New York City creates the Bit License. One of the most repressive regulations the crypto market has seen. Back then a lot of Bitcoin startups were in New York City and this Bit license regulation shut down a huge portion of the Bitcoin startups at the time. Even throwing in jail some of the more high profile people in Bitcoin at the time over weird technicalities. 

This crack down really hurt a lot if innovation and real world adoption that Bitcoin was going through at the time. Creating the biggest government hurdle that Bitcoin had to face yet. Nobody knew if Bitcoin would survive this. They were only a 1 Billion dollar asset at the time and there was no guarantee of network effect to withstand this kind of attack.   

 - Silk Road Shutdown

In late 2013 Silk Road was shutdown. It was the biggest real world use case for Bitcoin at the time. Since it was the first dark web marketplace to accept Bitcoin and then subsequently was shut down. A lot of people believed that was it for Bitcoin on the dark web. nobody new that a bunch of copycats would emerge over the years to pick up the mantle. All they new was that Silk Road was gone and with it the biggest real world use case for Bitcoin was taken too.

 - Blocksize wars 

Satoshi had left the project in 2011 but by 2014 Bitcoin was really starting to feel the loss of its figurehead when it came to the block size debate. Satoshi's word was almost like gospel back then. Anytime the blockchain needed an important decision or an emergency fix Satoshi was always there to lead the way. But now Satoshi had been gone for 3 years and the Block size debate was getting extremely divisive and personal.

Now I wont get into the benefits of both sides of the war since this post is about history and not technicals. But the main take away is that the community was divided in two and it was only going to get worse. leading to the Bitcoin Cash fork that split off half of the community. 

**Conclusion**
 
Add all this together with Bitcoin going down 90% from a high of 1k to a low of $100 then it seems like Bitcoin is bound to die... that is until it didn't. The next halving cycle came and Bitcoin shot up to the infamous 20k of the 2017 Bull cycle before crashing down again. In conclusion, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. not from the 2018 crash, not from this crash, and not from the 2026 crash. If Bitcoin can survive 2014 then Bitcoin can survive anything.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8ogr2,Could We Have Predicted This Dump? Look at ETH/BTC,"There are many technical indicators that I use when I trade/invest in crypto.  One useful indicator is ETH/BTC ratio.  In general, I don't really pay attention to any alts/BTC ratio except for (1) BTC dominance (2) ETH/BTC and (3) LTC/BTC.  We will discuss ETH/BTC below.

1. **What is ETH/BTC?**  ETH/BTC is simply the ratio between price of 1 ETH and price of 1 BTC.  Given that BTC has always been more expensive than ETH, ETH/BTC &lt; 1 and in most cases come between 0.02 and 0.10.  Qualitatively speaking, it reveals information about strength about ETH vs strength about BTC.
2. **When ETH/BTC is high, markets tend to dump.**  ETH/BTC had its peak at around February of 2018 (end of the last bull market) when it peaked at around 0.12.  For those of you who were around that time, this was the time when BTC was starting to look weak but ETH was flourishing (similar environment to right now).  And this concept of ""flippening"" started to take on a meme value in forums such as this one, where flippening refers to the process in which ETH overtakes BTC as the #1 crypto in the market.  In retrospect, that was the end of the bull cycle run as BTC faltered even further and soon afterwards, ETH tumbled down as well, while ETH/BTC went down dramatically for the rest of the 2018.
3. **So what about 2021?**  ETH/BTC hit some local peak values on couple of occasions:  (1) middle of May at 0.0824 (2) early September at 0.0795 and (3) present time at 0.083.  In all three cases after ETH/BTC hit its peak, BTC went down from 58K to 30K in mid May, 52K to 39K in early September, and 57 to 42K (and even lower?) right now.  So there is a lot of supporting data that an abnormally high ETH/BTC means that market is about to dump.
4. **So why does the market dump when ETH/BTC is high?**  This is my speculation.  ETH/BTC being high means that ETH is strong but more importantly, it means that BTC is weak.  So BTC is very vulnerable, but high ETH/BTC would also entail that the market prices in general is inflated.  As such, this is the type of condition that leads to a massive dump of the market.  And unfortunately, ETH has an asymmetric relationship with BTC in the sense that ETH cannot flourish when BTC is struggling (whereas BTC can flourish even when ETH is struggling).
5. **So what should I do the next time ETH/BTC is high?**  The smart thing is to start selling off your position and wait for the dump.  You would have benefitted from doing this in February of 2018, May of 2021, Sept of 2021, and present time.  And this indicator is something that builds up slowly so you have ample amount of time to react.  In this weird sense, if you are just trading using the ETH/BTC indicator and not HODLing, you don't have to even buy Bitcoin.  The simple strategy would be to buy ETH when ETH/BTC is low and sell to stablecoins when ETH/BTC is high.  It is weird that if you trade using soley this indicator, your portfolio would always be x% ETH and 100-x% stablecoins.  BTC would just be a useful index here.   And if you backward test this simple method, it would be insanely profitable. 

Hope you find this useful.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8ru9a,An old timer's perspective,"I just want to say that these hundreds of Youtube channels with some 20 year old doing their technical analysis charts on various cryptos have had me laughing my ass off for the past year. They're trying to apply the same TA parameter rules of an asset class that has been around for a hundred years+ (stocks) to an asset class that is really still in its infancy (crypto). 

I've been around for stock market crashes like 2002, 2008 and previous crypto crashes. Bought BTC in 2017 and then saw it go down to about $3000).

A couple of things to remember.

In the stock market you're lucky if you double your money in 10 years, in crypto you can 10x your money in a few days. (I've done it myself with LRC) So you need to realize that the reverse is also true and not bet the farm with money that you can't afford to lose.

Next, When the sh\*t hits the fan, EVERYTHING IS CORRELATED. For example, If the stock market takes a major sh\*t because of Covid fears or out of control interest rates, you can be 99% sure that BTC and ETH will follow, and in turn every alt coin will follow those two. Are you in for the long term? With real projects with a use case, not Santa Claus coin/cute doggie coin that serves no purpose? Then this is just noise. In the long term there will be a recovery and in increase from the previous ATH's

&amp;#x200B;

My current portfolio is BTC, ETH and a few alts that I feel are legit projects (ADA, XLM, LRC) What am I doing today?  I'm looking to dip my toe in on some of the lower cap alts that I don't have and felt I'd missed out on. Some of these are down like 20-25% today and I feel the bounce back in a recovery could be (percentage wise) better than that of the two big guys, BTC and ETH.  I grabbed some ALGO and AVAX, and increased my position in ADA. 

Good luck to all and keep your wits about you.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8ybgm,"Since its lowest point today, the total crypto market cap has recovered by about 400 billion dollars, or 21%. The entire market has grown by over one fifth since the bottom of the wick 15 hours ago.","At its lowest point today, the total crypto market cap according to TradingView's daily chart was $1.855 trillion, which is $553 billion below the daily open. At its lowest point, today's total market cap daily candle represented a 23% loss. The entire market was down by nearly a quarter.

At the time of writing, we have risen from that low by $400 billion, or 21%. With less than 4 hours left until the daily close, we are only about 6.1% down for total market cap for the day.

I'm not saying we are out of the woods yet, or that today has not been a big deal. But there is still hope that the correction we have been in for 24 days is basically a September-scale correction, rather than a May-scale correction (or even worse, the cyclic crash into the coming bear market).

We still have a ways to go to neutralize the -6.1% that we are sitting at for the day, but a -6.1% day is still a hell of a ways up from a -23% day.

PS: If you think my math doesn't add up because it seems like a 23% drop plus a 21% rise shouldn't leave us 6.1% down, just remember that, for example, you need 100% gains to recover a 50% loss, and you need 33% gains to recover a 25% loss.

People are selling their Alts for fiat. While BTC is being accumulated with amount on exchanges at ATL; 6.2%

[https://www.viewbase.com/exchange](https://www.viewbase.com/exchange)

On chain analysis shows that most BTC address are becoming HODLers. With OTC desks now accounting for nearly \~80% of BTC trade

So we have:

1. 6.2% of BTC on exchanges
2. Of that 6.2% most are HODLers
3. 80% of trading is via OTC limiting price impact
4. Alts bleeding against BTC but no movement in dominance

So who is selling BTC?

The answer is no one?

In simplest terms centralized exchanges; most likely Binance, Kucoin and Bitfinex are selling thin air via USDT backed leveraged trading. On Bitfinex alone ETH and BTC shorts are over 2 billion

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/)

But you asking yourself why would these shorts effect price so much?. They don't themselves but in combination with spot leveraged trading and USDT backed printed reserves. They create fictitious BTC balances in their users accounts

By which I mean that Tearher prints USDT to cover gaps in accounts on Binance and co. While Binance then leverages those amounts on trades. Creating fictitious BTC trades. With no real BTC being traded. Based on the open intrest and liquidations with no movement in BTC

I estimate that at least 60% to 70% of all BTC being traded is fictitious

This is in line with a past study that suggested that nearly 95% of trades where fictitious: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html)

However now with the aid of USDT those trades are trapping fiat in exchanges. Not just bogus limit orders to fatten the order books

If I'm even remotely correct it would mean that Binance is most likely insolvent. They are holding a huge amount of worthless USDT: [https://coinranking.com/coin/HIVsRcGKkPFtW+tetherusd-usdt](https://coinranking.com/coin/HIVsRcGKkPFtW+tetherusd-usdt)

As Binance at $28 billion USDT trading volume is 3x the next exchange

This USDT not their own BUSD is what is covering the fictitious BTC that they are trading. As in actuality Binance only holds $15 billion ( \~292k BTC) of which as discussed isn't being traded by the users.

[https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-coldwallet](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-coldwallet)

They most likely:

1. Started ""lending"" out users balances and displayed fictitious amounts in accounts
2. Due to supply shock started fractional accounts. Partially backed by USDT. E.g USDT supply increase correlated with BTC outflows from exchanges
3. Now actully are highly insolvent in both actual BTC and fiat. Holding mainly USDT

To clarify when I mean partially backed by USDT I mean that on Binance if your account says 2 BTC. You can only withdraw 1 BTC at most. The other BTC doesn't exist it's a fictitious BTC created by USDT backed trades on the platform.

Therefore if an actual parabolic run where to occur. It would be the worst case scenario for these exchanges. As they don't actully have the fiat or crypto to cover the withdrawals

If BTC when to $100k and people started wanting to exit. They wouldn't be able to exit in fiat but only USDT which is functionally useless outside the fictitious BTC scam. Of the decided to withdraw BTC from Binance to US backed ones such as Kraken and Coinbase it would be the same.

This is why \~ 80% of BTC trade is now OTC

So it is to the benefit of centralized exchanges to keep the price if BTC artificially low. Done through mass liquidations that reduce pressure on the system.

It is my belief that on May 19th 2021 it was the near collapse of this system that caused both the crash and the outages on exchanges. Totaling $1 trillion in value to be lost in hours",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8sxpw,I studied the Metaverse for 8 years and here's what I concluded:,"# Preface:

The Metaverse is a hypothetical version of the internet in which 3D avatars navigate a 3D space. Companies envision this world to be one where most people will live most of the most meaningful parts of their life in the future.

# 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard

As Metaverse enthusiasts, it's important to remember that we are likely the top 0.1% of computer users. Most people are confused by technology, overwhelmed by options and worried if they push the wrong button they will destroy something.

Chrome added a copy and paste feature to the menu because [people couldn't discover](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/only-one-in-10-know-what-ctrlf-does--here-are-shortcuts-you-should-know-20111130-1o69d.html) how to copy and paste.

Since the Metaverse simulates the countless possibilities of physical life, the complexity of the user interface gets out of hand quickly.

I remember testing out Second Life and accidentally taking off my pants and being unable to put them back on for 20 minutes.

Clearly, mouse and keyboard would not be a sufficient way of interacting with the metaverse.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space

18 years ago, Second Life came out and the hype around the Metaverse future was just as real back then as it is today. You can visit the empty government buildings, brand showcases and  cities to get a taste of the forgotten glory.

Time and time again people have been put together in a virtual space, and we still went back to physical life for real connections.

We have to ask ourselves, why did we leave virtual worlds and go back to physical life?

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships

The great benefits of any relationship are usually found in the most challenging operations of cooperation, marriage is a great example. Dating is exciting but sharing a life with someone is deeply sacrificial and yet, the benefits of marriage are enormous.

In  digital worlds we scarcely invest as heavily in relationships as in physical life. When we can go anywhere, be with anyone it's easy to constantly look for greener grass.

This problem is accentuated by the ability to change your name/avatar at will. When people can burn others and simply change their identity to escape consequences, they do. Investing in a real reputation and a single identity is the first step to solving this issue.

# 

# 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world

In digital worlds, we find ourselves mixed in with people from different cultures who have different values and interests. By contrast, in physical life we are naturally segmented with people who are more likely to share our values and ideas.

Gaming has the power to break ice between people and therefore has intrinsic utility to the Metaverse.

By using gamification we can organize and connect people of similar interests and values in a virtual space.

Not only that, gaming has the power to get people to relax. Human beings don‚Äôt develop meaningful friendships when forced into it. This is what social games and ‚Äúvirtual life‚Äù games often get wrong. Actual gameplay builds the context we need to relax and have a conversation to find people we are compatible with.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior

If you've ever lifted a baby and smiled at it, you know that facial expressions are deeply embedded in how we communicate. When we hurt someone's feelings, their facial expressions changes and, as we reciprocate their facial expressions, our body produces the same emotions as we make that individual feel. This acts as a natural tempering of our behaviour that we don't get when we communicate over the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world

A long time ago, there was a single company that dominated the telephone market. To call anybody who was the customer of the company you needed to have a phone that was with that same company, phones were not interoperable. Today, if you want to contact somebody on Facebook, you need Facebook to do so. This is how social networks defend their intellectual property.

Meta executive Jason Rubin:

‚ÄúThe first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,‚Äù Rubin wrote. ‚ÄúWe must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.‚Äù - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/30/facebooks-meta-mission-was-laid-out-in-a-2018-paper-on-the-metaverse.html)

The network effect is a scary prospect because it means that there will likely be only one Metaverse to rule them all in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. Customization is the enemy of usability

It's fascinating to bump into so many people who share the idea that no corporation should control the future of human interaction. However, it's laughable that we're using the same ill-advised ideas that allowed Facebook, Google and apps to dominate when it comes to this next chapter.

One of the reasons that Facebook overtook MySpace was that MySpace allowed people to customize their profile infinitely. This led to a myriad of different user interfaces, confusing navigation and a poor user experience.

Just imagine a myriad of virtual worlds all with their own user interface, controls and standards. The experience of travelling from world to world would be like being born all over again and having to learn how to read and write.

Therefore, the virtual world must have a single user experience to reach mass adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare

As the network effect brings everyone to a single Metaverse, the potential for the abuse of power will be astronomical. The Metaverse will understand where you are, who you are with and even what you look at.

AI will be able to process that data to better understand you than you yourself and data is the first step toward oppression.

Utilizing all this data, powerful individuals will have the ability to suppress dissent, identify people of contrarian opinion etc.

Moreover, if we begin to fool ourselves that we can agree on morals and values, those who [disagree with the mainstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) will live in constant fear of losing their friends, job and opportunities if they are banned from the Metaverse.

# 9. We can create a more ethical Metaverse future if we act now:

I sincerely believe that once the technology is established, and a real sense of presence can be found in a virtual world, the Metaverse will be inevitable.

Just imagine a world in which we do not need to build offices or school buildings oh, the cost savings themselves will drive people to virtual worlds if they have life-like fidelity.

I would like to start an initiative to ensure the Metaverse remains controlled by those who use it. In fact, I started a few years ago.

# The plan:

1. Make a game studio
2. Learn the ideal psychology to create real social organization in a virtual space
3. Start a collaborative movement to create a real Metaverse by the people and for the people

To be clear, what we're seeking to spark off is not another crypto/NFT thing but a place most ordinary gamers would play. Monetization can be focused on later.

t3_r8vy7b,"Don't get sucked into playing the game of ""Crypto Time Machine.""","""Crypto Time Machine"" is my term for the mental trap of ""*if only I had known*"" that people get carried away with.

*If only I had known* that BTC was destined for greatness back when faucets gave them for free.

*If only I had known* Solana was going to 30x in a matter of months.

*If only I had known* that March 2020 was the start of a massive bull run, and not a deeper bear market.

And today, *if only I had known* that half a billion dollars of positions were going to be liquidated overnight.

You didn't. You couldn't. People who predicted a crash were right by chance, just like people who predicted a sustained bull run in March were right by chance. There are so many predictions that someone is literally *always* right about *something.*

For veterans, this is just another one of those days. For newbies, I get that it's scary. But there's a reason that you hear people repeat the same things over and over. DCA. HODL. Buy projects you believe in. Never sell the dip. We are all early. Stay away from leverage. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

They're as true during the manic phase of a bull run as they are during a capitulation event like last night.

Don't torture yourself by imagining fantasy scenarios where you bought or sold at the perfect moments, and calculate what you *could* have right now had you only possessed a time machine.

Nothing but misery lies down that path. And yet, if you buy projects you believe in, DCA in, and HODL through the dips and crashes, there will probably be people posting here in 5 years saying ""OMG you're so *lucky* to have bought at X price!!""

But you'll tell them that you didn't feel lucky at the time. You felt like shit, because you played *crypto time machine* and tortured yourself through a two-year bear market. Ask me how I know.

So don't be like I was. Don't play *crypto time machine*. Just keep calm and HODL on.",CryptoCurrency

For those unaware, if you sell a stonk for a loss, and buy a similar stonk within 30 days, you are not allowed to claim that capital loss on your tax return.

There is no such limitation on your crypto transactions. If you need to harvest a loss to reduce your tax liability, you can buy right back into the same crypto asset.

t3_r8yo32,So what do we do when we take profit?,"We've just lived yet another Friday night BTC Crash. And the same posts started to pop up in here with similar title: ""something something Take Profit"". 

I do feel this sentiment, and highly support it. 

But we have a dilemma. When we take profit, what do we do with it? Where do we put it?

As we already know, when BTC crashes, it takes everything down with it. It doesn't care about the project, the fundamentals. When BTC is down, we're all down. 

Unless when you take profit you send it to a stable coin, most likely you will put it into another coin/token.  And when BTC goes down, everything goes down. Therefor you profit, in non stable coin, goes down too.

So what do we do when we take profit? Do we completely exit out? 

If we keep on fearing another dip/crash, we will never get back in. DIP/Crash are unpredictable (for most people), but part of the lifecycle of Crypto.

Honestly I think this is part of the Risk/Reward Equilibrium. Some will gain, some will lose. 

And staying in stable coins, for fear of a crash, most likely we will be missing out on some great gains. 

As an example, let's say you sold Solana at $90, you took your profit to stable coins feeling good, smart and happy; then you see SOL is continuing and going towards $300.

If you manage to NOT sell during the next week or so, you will benefit from the upside of this healthy crash/dip!  

Diamond hands / balls are earned out of respect for those that can HODL like no other.  This may be the first big dip for some of you, its ok, check out for a few days and come back to see the prices going right back up.  Just like we go straight down, we can go straight up as well.

t3_r8xlu9,Solana library bug could have seen attackers stealing $27 million an hour,"  

* A bug impacting major Solana projects, which had been publicly disclosed, sat unnoticed for six months.
* Security researchers estimated that it could have stolen thousands of dollars per second.

 The bug worked as follows. Simply put, for Solana apps there‚Äôs a  mechanism for when you put funds in and take them out. If the protocol  followed the SPL reference documents, then they would round funds to the  nearest whole number at the point of withdrawal. This would only happen  if the user was owed a fraction of the smallest unit of reference,  known as a Lamport (this is similar to a satoshi, the smallest amount of  bitcoin).

Now this worked both ways. Some people would end up with an extra  fraction of their tokens. Other people would end up with slightly less  than they were owed. But it would be a minuscule amount per person, and  on average would roughly equal out.

But were someone to game the system, the researchers wondered, surely  they could end up taking the tiny extra amounts? And were they to do  this over and over again, perhaps they could make significant amounts of  money.

 The researchers estimated they could execute this bug 150-200 times in a  single transaction and put many of these transactions in a single  block. They figured such an exploit could steal funds at a rate of  $7,500 per second, or $27 million an hour. 

 The researchers swiftly contacted multiple Solana projects that they  believed were affected by this bug. Since many Solana projects are [closed-source](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/125753/solana-projects-closed-source),  it was a much harder task and they wrongly identified a couple of  projects. But they managed to get in contact with Solend, Tulip and  Larix, which all fixed the bug.

Since the bug was disclosed, Solana Labs has also fixed the reference  documents to make sure that new projects following its instructions  won‚Äôt introduce it again.

TL;DR: get your formal methods and verification ready if you want to play with big boys!

t3_r8z7fy,The average crypto developer earns $165k a year salary.,"One of the biggest problems in crypto is that projects don't have enough Devs to get upgrades done in a timely manner, this is an issue that almost every project goes through at one time or another and there's a good chance the projects you are invested in are hiring.

If you have a background in programming and you think that crypto is the future and want to be a part of that, what are you waiting for? I don't know any coding languages myself but others have said that rust and solidity tend to have the smallest learning curve and are the easiest to learn.

Its also not to late to start learning if like me you don't know anything about writing code, you can start with python and c++ and learn solidity and rust from there all inside of 18 months if you put your mind to it.

The majority of projects will be looking for people with experience but if you can bring something to the table I'm sure you would be given an opportunity to atleast write code part time. Bug bountys and finding alerting projects of exploits is also a good entry to a career in coding blockchain technology, maybe toy around with building your own smart contracts so you can show potential employers what you are capable of.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r90ogs,"To the people scoffing at failed predictions, TAs, traders, etc, stop embarrassing yourself.","Often we see posts here about how TA is a scam, how predictions don't work and how 'experts' are just making a fool out of you for views . But since this recent crash it has been crazy. couple of posts in top already and comments on pretty much every post related to recent crash/dip.   


You don't understand what technical analysis means, you don't understand that stock (and crypto) predictions are more about probabilities than about predicting future accurately. You don't understand that even the most indicators/patters that are also thought to be the most reliable are never 100% reliable, i think most reliable patterns are at best 79% accurate. And even then they don't account for external factors.   


Most patterns and indicators are based on how people are behaving and how people behave during certain conditions. It's not a given that that WILL happen. No one can account for a COVID variant messing up markets, or anxiousness about new regulations or taxes.   


If you actually read about any TA of stock movement then you'll realize that most TAs suggest that it's possible that market will move a certain way, no TA can ever predict what will exactly happen. And even if the most accurate and reliable patterns emerge that have proven to be 80% accurate, it just means that there's still 20% chance of the prediction not working out. 

And even then, if PlanB's 98k prediction has proven to be wrong for nov end, it doesn't mean that it cant happen in this cycle. Maybe it'll happen by next week's end , or in next 15 days, or it'll never happen and whole of crypto will crash down to zero amidst global crackdown.   


Predictions and charting are about probabilities, it's about human behavioral patterns based on history of trading and can go either ways. It's not a sci-fi script  by a hollywood writer that will pan out word by word.   


If you want to understand what TAs and other indicators mean and how they pan out or not then go take a beginners course in trading, I am by no means an expert but knowing about basics of it all certainly helps in understanding what's exactly going on. It's def. better than calling everyone out there doing TAs and predictions as idiots and scammers.   


Also, please stop adding  ""everybody  knows shit about fuck"" &amp; DYOR like an angsty teenager after every sentence. No one can predict future in any field, it doesn't mean that nobody knows anything.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r9196z,I'm working on an online RPG with its economy tied to crypto.," I've been knocking this idea around in my head for months so I finally started designing it to figure out how this would actually work. I have another game project on the go which I plan to sell for meme coins with a burn percentage (mainly for Dogelon) however this new project is completely different.

This would be a crypto infused game that you would be playing to play the game, not simply to earn crypto currency. The world economy would have a wallet for a meme coin (think Dogelon, Polydoge, Babydoge) with in-game currency tied directly to it, similar to a wow system of copper to silver to gold, where 10k in the smallest in-game currency would equal 1 meme coin.

You'd be able to buy in for a % fee and withdraw for a % fee, these fees alone should be able to keep the game economy alive. Maybe there could be a subscription service however I don't want to sell things that break the game for free users.

So this is the initial idea of the core mechanic behind this games economy and I thought I would run it by everyone in this community to gather thoughts and ideas. Maybe there is something I can do better? There are a lot of trash crypto currency games out there that are there to take your money and act as glorified savings accounts with shitty rates. I want my game to stand out, and the crypto to simply be a realistic bonus that is tied to the game.

What do you guys think? You guys got any ideas to add to this? How could it be made better? Is there an idea for a subscription service that wouldn't break the game for free players?",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8zt6h,We always hear statements like ‚Äútake profits‚Äù But how? Here are some basic strategies for taking profits and learning what that means,"It‚Äôs all about strategy. Come up with a game plan an execute. One strategy called an ‚ÄúInfinite Return‚Äù has you invest X amount of dollars and when you get to the point of 50%-100% increase, you sell your original investment and keep the profit invested in that coin. Now you have your original investment money back to invest again into a new project and the house‚Äôs money to play with in this new coin. Any money made off of the house‚Äôs money is an ‚ÄúInfinite Return‚Äù. Free money. Alternate Strategy is to sell everything and pool all the money together for the next investment. Example, you start with $200. You get to the 50% gain and you sell. Now you have $300 for the next investment. Rinse and repeat. Oversimplified but that‚Äôs the gist of it.

Everyone here is learning about the power of ‚ÄúDCAing.‚Äù If you get stuck in a losing position, learn to DCA while the price pulls back and look for an exit on a push up. The key is to pick good projects you don‚Äôt mind getting ‚Äústuck into‚Äù. If you are picking riskier projects, it gets harder to sleep at night on down days. 

Another classic strategy is the ‚ÄúBuy and Hold‚Äù. You buy it and forget about it. Work your 5,10,20 year plan. Remember 80% day traders lose money. Much easier to hold for the long term and pick an exit. 

Personally, 90% of my portfolio is holding long term for the last 5 years and just adding to my positions when I can. But recently, the last year or two, 10% of my portfolio is now used for swing trading. Keeping some stable coins for days like this and not using them all at once. Always save some ammunition for an even bigger dip or pullback.

There are lots of different strategies. Learn some, come up with a game plan, and execute. Work the plan.

t3_r8sjte,"This ""crash"" is exactly why you shouldn't talk about crypto during Christmas dinner","We've seen similar posts about this before Thanksgiving, but this crash/dip, whatever you wanna call it (personally I've been calling it Greg) is exactly why you should NOT be talking about crypto during Christmas dinner with your family, S.O. or coworkers. Maybe with your dog or your cat.

What I'm trying to say is that Thanksgiving was last week and I'm pretty sure crypto somehow managed to be a topic in some of your dinners. Maybe an uncle wanted to know more about BTC, a cousin was flexing about his DOGE gains or whatever. And seeing all this red, I can't help but wonder how people who decided to get into crypto after hearing about it or the first time last week time are feeling right now - and if that's your case, just HODL. I think that no matter how cool and entertaining crypto can be, we should be very careful when it comes to recommending investing in it - or investing in anything, really.  
The reality is if tell someone to invest and they make huge gains, they'll make it about themselves. How they managed to pick a great coin, blahblahblah. But if somehow they fail - have you seen the markets these past 10-12h? trust me, that's probably the case - they will somehow blame you. So basically if it goes right, you don't get credit.

Should you buy more or wait. Nobody knows.
Should you sell now and buy lower, heh nobody knows.

What we do know is crypto has died 1000 times and always came back stronger.

If you have no money to add but belive in crpyto then this is a good time to research projects and maybe get to learn some basic technical analysis.

Make sure to prepare your plan. When will you take profits , how will you go about when certain targets a are reached. Hodling is nice but imo hodling 100 percent of your portfolio is not ideal.

For example i hodl only 3 projects and the rest i have to sell and profit from after which i will put the gains in to stablecoins and earn returns on them.

I bought ETH at 1.200‚Ç¨ and was extremely happy because everything was going great, but I paper handed like crazy and sold everything because I got scared of the dumps after february~march, and broke even with some coins or took loses with others. Not many months later this whole bull run started and I had no fiat to buy anything, I just thought I got late. A couple months later I got a job and got some fiat to burn, and I started buying again at around ETH 3k.

  Now there is another big crash, but I've learned my lesson. This time I didn't spend money I wasn't ready to lose, and even have a little left over to buy during the dip and I'm HOPING that it will dip even further because I know in a matter of months it's going back up again and maybe even further than before.

t3_r84lqx,How I used the blockchain against scammers who scammed me and got them to double my funds free of charge,"Quick TL:DR of what happened in my [previous post](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/r4ebvs/how_i_got_scammed_and_how_you_can_avoid_ending_up/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

  Basically, I got a phishing DM on discord and clicked on the link, thinking that a project I was following was finally live and allowed me to mint. I thought all of my money was lost, and hit a dead end everywhere I looked, but luckily all hope wasn‚Äôt lost, and I was able to miraculously recover my funds + basically doubled what I had while causing the scammers to waste thousands of dollars on gas

Now for the meat and the potatoes of what happened as soon as I got scammed. I immediately freaked out and tried to do whatever I can to uncover the identity of these scammers. The phishing website they created (now deleted) was https://fox-game.art/ and i did a Whois lookup, but the scammers had covered their tracks pretty well [as seen here](https://imgur.com/a/zIh0eZm). They‚Äôd used namecheap (which basically hides their true email, IP, address, phone number, etc) so the details of the website couldn‚Äôt be traced back to them.

Now I decided lemme check out the blockhain and see previous transactions that they did, [from their address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d8d12f3f242ef6c409b2fec7ebb0dcdfcfa348a), and I found out they had sent their funds over to a [proxy address](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f692afe5e4e81509506ecca24445e5393cacee6f9a9502d4f5d65521ee0b5aa) before [cashing out via fixedfloat](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf37593fb40eaf81e8c1d7630ca64e3e7e3f4f6dcaed923077863c1eec3956039)

Armed with this info I fired off an email o fixedfloat, and to the privacy email address which was connected to their email (think of it like a string of characters that each individual using namecheap has, but until they reply, their real email isn‚Äôt exposed), and hoped that something happened. As a matter of fact, something did happen. Fixedfloat reached out to me and announced they blacklisted their wallet, and they‚Äôd freeze their funds the next time they made a transaction, and the scammers, freaked out by the threatening email I sent tried to cash out 0.067 eth, or the amount the scammed from me via fixedfloat as a test to see if my threat had any sustenance.

And it did! Fixedfloat froze the 0.067 eth they sent, and the scammers freaking out emailed me( don‚Äôt know if I can share em here because of doxxing stuff) but they immediately refunded the eth they stole from me, and started begging me to tell fixed float that I had made a mistake with my report, so I decided to play their game, and wasted their time by telling them that the only way I‚Äôd help em out is if they sent 1 ETH to the burn address, but sadly they were cheap stakes and realized that the situation had reached a point of no return, and basically moved their funds out via tornado cash

Fixedfloat said they‚Äôd refund me if they got an email from a law enforcement agency and pass on the scammers info, or if 3 months passed, and they didn‚Äôt hear anything back from them (I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt have anything to say since the scammers spent 0.15 ETH a moving money into tornadocash)

Either way, I was super lucky that the scammers took my bait and responded to my email I sent, and they revealed their email, as well as refunded me, but there are a couple of things you can do if your in a similar situation, and ended up getting scammed, even though prevention and being smart is the best way to avoid the headache in the first place.

 1. Do a Whois lookup, and try to find the scammers email or other identifying information and reach out to them, and notify them that your going to report them to law enforcement unless they refund you

 2. Check out their wallet, because they have to convert their crypto to fiat at one point, and often use a swap service or centralized exchange, to whom you can reach out to 

 3. File a police report and contact other law enforcement entities because most exchanges will use that to release their funds back to you, if they seize em, or forward their information to law enforcement agencies so they can pursue charges

Edit : Really appreciate the attention that this post has gotten, but I‚Äôm NOT advocating for you to willingly send scammers money to try to get more back, it WILL NOT work unless the scammers are extremely stupid, and you‚Äôll end up losing it, or spending a long ass time recovering it",CryptoCurrency

Back in 2018 I read an article about ETH that I found on twitter. I instantly downloaded Coinbase and bought $350 worth of ETH. At the time I was a sophomore in college so this was most of the cash I had in my bank account. I told my roommate about it and convinced him to buy some as well. 

Fast forward 3 months and we‚Äôre both down 50%. My roommate sold and it scared me to sell as well. I thought to myself, this is going nowhere. 

Fast forward again a little over two years and I‚Äôm now working a full time job. One of my co-workers talks me into buying DOGE. My money doubles overnight. This was when DOGE was trading at less than a penny and hadn‚Äôt been hyped up. I sold and felt like a genius (if only I would have known).

But, that one day changed my whole perspective on cryptocurrencies. I hadn‚Äôt seen gains close to that in the stock market. I started to do my own reaserch and found good projects to start investing in. Within two weeks I had converted 90% of my stock portfolio to crypto.

t3_r8tn6h,Fed December 15th Meeting Can Trigger The Depression... Trade Accordingly,"Powell hinted this week that an acceleration of tapering is possible due to inflation. The Fed is in a quiet period until their meeting on December 15th. On this day a press release will be released to indicate if an acceleration of tapering will happen. 

If the December 15th press release indicates accelerated tapering will occur, you will immediately see red in the market, and unfortunately the deleveraging process will accelerate and pop the market. We are in the end of a long term debt cycle (~100 year cycle) for the macro environment and anyone following this knows it's just a matter of time. 

If the December 15th meeting states tapering will not be accelerated, then the markets live on a bit longer.

However, Powell was recently renominated and no longer owes any allegiance to Biden. He went against Biden this week during a hearing and hinted at accelerated tapering. Powell was nominated first by Trump. The Republicans do not want more inflation. And now that Powell knows his renomination is behind him, I think he will indeed taper on the 15th. This will trigger the end of easy money until they reverse course and print the next more massive round of stimulus. 

It's in the interest of Republicans to make the economy look bad around now, which is perfect timing for critical mid-term campaigns for US Congressmen. 

Why is this the straw that breaks the camel's back? (1) Markets will immediately price in higher probabilities of interest rates increases in 2022+ due to risk of hyper inflation. This will have a cascading effect on the market that is over leveraged from excessive access to easy money. (2) Real productivity in the world is down due to the pandemic. These two key factors combined are enough to trigger the unwinding of leverage in the system. The end of more money... chasing less productivity... is a recipe for disaster... as it necessitates a correction. 

I would short crypto on the 15th if accelerated tapering is announced. Don't hesitate just sell on such news. The bottom will reverse once the government gets ready for its next bigger round of stimulus. Prepare your mind for volatility, be patient, trade well, good luck everyone.

t3_r8vata,"TA is only good as the data we got, possible evidence of manipulation, and a look at a few things that could happen","First thing is first, lets get into the manipulation bit because that interest me a bit more. As I mention in my past post here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r87uyu/interesting\_events\_i\_noticed/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r87uyu/interesting_events_i_noticed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

the other night a number of banking people and investment firms was telling me to set stop losses before yesterday. I made a post about it, and some people were indicating some comments like a clock is right twice a day while ignoring this info was coming from the elite. I ended up commenting on that reply saying what I was worried about is it's more of an internal thing and how they know the news before we know it type of thing. It ended up getting downvoted to hell, I figured the problem passed and maybe the warning was the UBS Bank news mix with the new virus news, so I deleted it and figure maybe they were right. I wish I didn't delete it, but still. With what happened today it gets me wondering a bit more about this.

In that post I mentioned these are people I share TA but they aren't my friends. Let me expand on that a bit more. I'm high functioning autistic. That alone causes many elite companies and to be honest practically any company that isn't low level fast food to not want me. And this is even with me having 4 degrees and tons of certs. And what makes it worse, I pretty much have to work fully remote because driving starts becoming a problem and moving means completely leaving what little support network I have. I've seen NO company open to hiring an autistic person fully remote unless if they have several decades of experience and this is even with how the virus stuff going. Like in general autistic people with a degree have about an 85% unemployment rate.

Now with that being said, being it's my upbringing, me being autistic, or something else. It is extremely easy for me to start seeing patterns in things and think way outside of the box. This means if I have enough data, TA is easy for me. But because it's easier in a group, and because people in banking and investment firms can have a hard time with this. I bounce stuff off them. I get a confirmation on if I'm on the right track and if they see what I'm seeing, and they get to have an easier time in their job and keep their job. It's a win win on that. Now, they aren't my friends because these same people will stab anyone in the back and they 100% know about my situation but do not lift a finger to help. And the conversation starts and ends with how they can be helped.

So again, I wonder as I mention in my prior post.

1. The thing where if 2 people hold a secret sooner or later it will get out, and basically people knew you know what is about to hit the fan and they wanted to do the right thing at the risk of their job. (That or they know if I lose my motivation and care in this, then I stop helping them since I don't even get paid by them. I only get a confirmation if they see the same thing I am.)
2. This is a campaign to manipulate the market. Basically get retail investors to sell so it drive a massive dip so elite can buy it up to make the EOY profits sky high as the prices will rise later this year (or at least past projections and current projections still say).
3. Or maybe I'm reading too much into this.

# TA and data

Anyways, lets get into TA in general. TA is only as good as the data we have. As mentioned before, there is some likely this is manipulated. But even if it isn't, TA is the difference between going in completely blind or going in with some things you know and working with that.

Basically, TA for me for it to be useful it needs to have an 80% accuracy rating. Which means 20% of the time it still can run into problems like we did last night.

As far as I can tell, almost no one in TA seen this coming. This is both a good and bad thing. If the market really is manipulated to this degree, then it's good because it means we didn't miss anything and short of being a part of the manipulation we wouldn't had the data anyways. Bad if it wasn't being manipulated because that means we most likely missed something.

There is another possibility btw. This is just my personal side theory. But China is doing a crack down on their citizens investing in crypto and foreign stuff. Like they are trying to bring back the money because China is about to go bankrupt in a number of years or decades if they don't fix the problem now. Anyways, my side theory is this could be a lot of China money leaving both the normal market and crypto.

# Scenario

1. We are in another Wyckoff situation (consolidation). The chart above shows what happened last time and what would it look like this time. It's pretty much the exact same price range, and we will be looking at May maybe if it plays out a 1:1 which I doubt even if this one happens. There isn't enough data yet on this to prove or disprove this one. So even if it is true, there isn't enough data to give good timeframes.
2. We might bounce back up. I doubt this.
3. We are now in a bear market. The likely if this is true we could see the price go down to $10k-$15k range. This is the worse case. I think it is way too soon to say for sure on this one. And to be honest, I think this is the least likely.

I think the most likely is 1. There is some likely the price won't go down as much as it did last time. Call it what you want, but it's likely to consolidate for a few months. The good news is this is the case, this means when it does go up in a few months. We could be looking at $300k at the peak or higher. But again, we don't have enough data on that to confirm it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I will get some will point out I just basically said the price will go up down. But these are people who most likely will lose at the end of the day because they miss the forest from the trees type of thing. The point of this is we are talking about massive massive massive swings. You need to seriously think about each situation and what you would do if x y or z happens.

For example, if it drops below $38k then it is likely to keep going until $30k-$28k. If it breaks through that then it could be a true bear market. If it shoots back up then it's likely we will go to $90k or $100k and then the bull market will be done after it's peak. If we consolidate and do sideways action for a few months, it's likely we will see this at it's peak to get close to $300k and in some situations higher.

In all situations year over year however. If you hold if it does go in a bear market it is likely you might go down in value a good while. If it jumps or consolidates. It is likely your value will increase next year this time. So there is a lot to think about.

If people are interesting in it. As we get more data, I will make updates in the future.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8qii1,Some advise about Crypto and what people can actually do right now..,"I have been in crypto for years (2012) since I bought in the earlier stages and also I have been in the stock market for a long time (1988). Every Bull and Bear market bring new lessons on what could or should have been done into your own investments. It's what makes us a better investor in the long haul and if you keep the strategies now you will do really well in the future.

1 This board and other places are really harping on it and it's the greatest thing I have ever seen. DCA in and slim down positions when up heavy. When the bear strikes and it will for both crypto and the stock market set aside money every month and split it out between good companies and or crypto. 

2 Spread out your investments and cover a wide range like ETH, BTC pick (don't want to shill) 3-4 more and dca every month. Same with stocks pick good stocks that will be around forever ie Google, Visa, United Healthcare on and on (don't want to shill stocks either). Take some profit when they are up 30-40 percent and let the rest ride. This will kill the FOMO and FUD and make you a better investor.

3 There is actually something you can do to help crypto here and yourself. I know this has been said forever in these forums, but here we go again. NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COIN. Pull your coins from the exchanges. First if a big exchange ever gets hacked you could be in trouble. Next by pulling them  you are taking away ammo from these giant whales that use YOUR bitcoin to move the prices. Defi is also lending out, and the only one I do not stake is bitcoin. How Bitcoin goes the market will follow. so even pull your BTC instead of getting that low 4%. 

4 We are actually do for a crash in both the stock market and crypto. Instead of worrying about it make it a fucking golden opportunity. If you are in your 20's you will probably experience 7-10 crashes in your time. This is your time to shine and instead of fretting it's time to plow in. There will be times you will regret your decisions during a long bear market , but as long as what you bought and you believe in you will do well. 

5 I have seen a lot of people talk about the dot com bubble and I was in it full tilt. What people really don't understand is the magnitude of the hit at the start. The NAZ went from 5000 to 3250 in very short time. It trapped a lot of people at the top, and instead of investing wisely they turned to what I call prayer investing, and don't look at your account ever. I know the stock market and crypto are not the same, but the lesson is still there. Buy good companies, crypto or whatever over time and it will pay off down the road. 

6 The canary in the coal mine. Again this is a stock but the same pattern hold true for crypto. I took a hard look at DOCU or DocuSign yesterday. It was down 42% and there was absolute no strength  or even a semblance of any rally. Investors are dumping growth and speculative plays and you can see it. Those DocuSign investors are going to be underwater for the next 10 years. If something like that happens to your investment can you hold out for that long. If the answer is no I think it's time you take a little off the table, because bear markets get really bad and fast so DON""T INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8xnjk,This dip / crash is why taking profits is always a good idea.,"Crypto is extremely volatile. 

Always have a target. When it hits the target, sell a portion. Set multiple targets! Also set multiple targets for buying the dips. 

Imagine when BTC was at $45k 3 months ago, you set targets to sell at $55k, a higher portion at $65k. An even higher portion to sell at $75k etc.

And made buying targets at small portion at $38k, $30k etc.

This works only if you set targets at different prices for eg. When BTC is at $60k you set buying targets at $50k. 

You would‚Äôve made a good profit and still had a good amount of BTC. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have had as much profit as if you would‚Äôve sold at an ath but it‚Äôs still profit regardless and we all know it‚Äôs impossible to time the market.

If I had to pick between buying Bitcoin here or buying Ethereum here, I would definitely go with Ethereum.

And also, while this may trigger Bitcoin maxi's, I don't agree with the idea that most of your portfolio ""needs"" to be in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may be the safest bet, it'll probably also give the lowest return from here. 

If you don't like taking big risks or you want to hold for 10 years, then Bitcoin is the best option. Or if you're a multi-billionaire and you want to be sure to have liquidity.

But if you're a trader, if you don't think we're in a bear market yet, and if you're not a billionaire, I would pick Ethereum over Bitcoin anyday.

t3_r8xaxp,How crypto can break free from the stock market,"Despite becoming it's own mini economy, when people become fearful, the price action in crypto seems to perfectly match the American stock market. 

On some level, it makes sense. During a market correction people become more risk adverse and review all their holdings with fear. Bitcoin etfs get sold off en mass (they almost always trade bellow fair value) and newcomers jump ship.

This is the unfortunate reality of being largly tethered to US currency.

But it doesn't always have to be this way.

As bitcoin and other major cryptos continue to gain legitimacy, the price action could start to stabilize independently of the larger markets (or perhaps move inversely like gold).


I belive that if the crypto market can transition into a pattern of steady growth instead of kangaroo jumps, major coins will be seen as safe havens in times of economic uncertainty. And the good news is, every year coins hold their value (and btc is up huge this year) works to increase investor confidence.

""**Why Is Community Important To Mental Health?**

We‚Äôre social beings, and we are not meant to live in isolation. Community is critical for us to thrive, especially for someone with mental illness who is already experiencing the common symptoms of loneliness and isolation.¬†Community provides many elements that are critical to mental health, but here are three of the most beneficial aspects.

**Belonging**  
If you‚Äôve ever felt like you don‚Äôt fit in, you know it can be a lonely experience. Community provides a sense of belonging ‚Äî a group you identify as being a part of. This is different than conforming to be in a group. A true sense of belonging includes the ability for you to feel you are a part of the community as your true self. There is not anything you have to change to be a part of the community, but instead, you are embraced and appreciated for your unique qualities.

**Support**  
Who do you turn to when you need something? Having people you can call on when you need to talk or need help with something can help you through difficult situations that might feel insurmountable alone. Knowing there are people who support you¬†¬†can help you feel cared for and safe, and can benefit your outlook on life.

**Purpose**  
In community, people fill different roles. Perhaps you‚Äôre the friend who enjoys cooking and can be counted on to bring a hot meal over when someone is going through something. Or you‚Äôre the friend who others know they can call when they need to talk about their struggles. These roles can give you a sense of purpose through bettering other people‚Äôs lives. Having purpose, and helping others, helps give meaning to life.""

As long as we can agree on this one basic thing, I think we'll agree on the rest. *Cryptocurrencies have proven to be a long-term sustainable marketplace.* I say this not only because of it's decade plus long ability to grow, but also because of it's now moving into government and large-scale business trades. There are going to be countless prop-ups and setbacks, as every market has.

Every market. Stocks are only one. Real estate, commodity trades, lending, antique/etc., every kind of market sees growth, setbacks, periods of uncertainty, periods of near-collapse, etc. Crypto isn't any different - and that's important. Because your opinions of macro-scale events in crypto will most likely be tempered by your outlook on investing in general.

The most obvious comparison is to the stock markets. Every one throughout time has been different, but the NYSE is a good example of how major events and differing periods have changed over time. And the cool thing is, we've got a good 200+ years of data to use. And on a *macro* scale - that's fucking enormous!

I totally stole this image. But it's a great representation of markets within the NYSE over it's entire existence. The one single thing that it has *always* done, is grow. It's got no reason not to. 

[https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/200-years-u-s-stock-market-sectors\/](https://preview.redd.it/ilm7v0b7xf381.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=868dded393441c3ae1d1bc0cf786bd80666e3900)

Major events are pretty visible, the Civil War, the Depression, the dot/com boom, etc. (Check out the real estate pinch in '08). Point being - it's *always* changing. And this is just the markets *within the market as a whole.*

We don't have the best data for the 1800s. It exists, but I'm not going to pay for the good datasets. So I'm going to pick it up at the 1900s with the DJI. 

[https:\/\/stockcharts.com\/freecharts\/historical\/marketindexes.html](https://preview.redd.it/7vo6gr8tyf381.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ce70d77714ea3f2774026b33d2bf06cc265df5)

Again, you can see all the major events pretty clearly. When you zoom out, the Depression was a correction. The 40's were slow recovery. The 50's were back on pace. The 60s were a boom. The 70s were a correction. The 80s and 90s were to the moon. And then the game changed entirely. And that's where we come in.

Since the early 2000s, market movements haven't been in decades (as seen above). They've been in years. And even *more* recently, they've been in months. There are a million reasons why, and I'm not here to argue about those - that's not for crypto. Crypto is just feeling the ripples of these movements. But knowing the context helps put crypto movements in a much better perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

[DJI 1990 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/ohgs50ci2g381.png?width=1566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=765c581e2763ad6449dd5f0728a693ddb271c2b0)

The stock markets aren't flinging around pocket change anymore. We're on a fucking rocket. And we have been, since 2009. Everything took off in 90s. 1995 to be specific. And that bull trend didn't break, even with the war starting in the early 2000s, until midway through the '07-09 recession. Then, you can argue it however you want. Overcorrection? Probably, but we took the fuck off. And the only thing so far that has really stopped us hard has been the beginning of the pandemic. Recovery throughout the pandemic, at least in the markets, has been insane. In the last ten years, the beginning of Covid-19 is the *only* major market setback, and we already recovered. The recovery is the issue.

And now we find ourselves here.

&amp;#x200B;

[DJI 2019 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/ipshsllk6g381.png?width=1566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e00ac0d64c5f81d0d14961adc4ae16884d3d4870)

These last two years have been crazy, right? Insane bull runs. Huge recovery. Didn't break trend until June '21. And now we've found ourselves (stock market-wise) in a consolidation period with some pretty strong support at 34000. 

Now, if you ask me - and I know you didn't, the growth over 2019 was far more sustainable. We shoved *everything* at pandemic recovery and FUD. And we rebounded insanely fast. Like, too fast. You can argue the recovery from 2008 took too long at 5+ years, but you can't argue it didn't maintain it's growth. And then, IMO, the previous administration decided to play casino and the markets ran with it. And then, within a couple of years, it all caught back up with itself into some mild correction. And then the pandemic. And you can see the crazy fast recovery has tapered and left us kind of sitting around 35,000. 

So, why the fuck does all this matter? 

BECAUSE CRYPTO IS BRAND FUCKING NEW. You've spent a decade in crypto? Sweet, me too. You know what that means? Absolutely nothing. Because go take a look at the first chart again of market sectors. NOTHING IS EVERY STATIC. EVER. And crypto did something most markets can't pull off in their infancy, it created massive sub-markets that have continued to grow. Crypto isn't just BTC. It's blockchain. It's far bigger than just BTC, even though we'll use BTC as a metric for decades to come still.

The stock markets grew from finance, to mainstay transportation, energy, and a host of other major submarket sectors. Crypto has been doing the same, at an accelerated pace. From simple finance, to logistics, to defi, to web3, to now meta, and who the fuck knows what's next. Markets will never fail as long as one thing remains true - it's profitable. And they are.

This is what happens when crypto goes from being Bitcoin to being an entire market capable of sustaining multiple projects, multiple directions, and un-ending potential. You almost don't even need to change the titles on the first chart to believe it's what's happening to crypto. Diversification.

Here's my last chart, I swear. And it will hopefully put crypto into perspective. What has happened in the last two years. It's not 2013. It's not 2018. It's almost not even 2021 anymore. 

I left time boxes on because it's pretty much the only way to identify the stock market exists.

t3_r8rswi,I now understand a little better what these crashes are all about...margin calls and short liquidations.,"I know someone that got lquidated last night cause he thought a coin had hit the bottom and bought with margins. But the price kept on dropping and he lost it all.   That is the game, the market lures as much peope/money in as possible with gains and euphoria for weeks and months.  Fatten all the fish(that's us) up with margins, loans, and all, making most of us believe or forget that the price would ever go down to previous lows again.   And then when all the fish are stuffed as fuck as possible, the whales and sharks drops their nets, some get caught right away on the first swoop, and some a little further down cause they thought it was safe not believing or forgetting how far and deep the nets can go.  And the nets keep dropping down for more sweeps, catching the unexpecting fish. Then it's rinse and repeat.  It's the hodlers that bring up the value of the coins year to year.  It's the traders using margins and short callers that cause these massive drops.   Then it's rinse and repeat.  As more hodlers increase, the whales just play with higher prices, which hardly matters at all, it's all about percentages.

It kind of reminds me of this like a game I use to play often at Chuck E Cheeses - I forget the name but it was just a thin plastic ball in a tube suspended by blowing air that the player controls.  You make it go up in the tube  by giving it more air and lower the ball by reducing the air. The limitation was with how quick you can move the ball, it falls at the speed of gravity and goes up with the limited air pressure.    The idea was to keep the ball between a moving range. If you get out of range you lose.  So the player was to anticipate the move of the range with limited controls.   It starts off easy, but as the player succeeds further and further in time, the range begins to move faster and more erratic until it catches you.   I loved that game cause I was able to make it to the end more often than most people.  That game reminds me of the game traders play here.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r8g2w1,Ethereum: A Deep Dive. Here's why Ethereum is the opportunity of a lifetime.,"# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is the largest smart contract blockchain in the world, and it's native coin ether (ETH) is the second most valuable cryptocurrency. As a smart contract chain, it essentially operates as a decentralized computer. You can run all kinds of decentralized and trustless applications on this computer like DEX's (Decentralized Exchanges) for example. It's also very popular with NFT's. Every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain takes up a resource called gas. There is a limited amount of data that can go in each block, therefore there is a limited amount of gas. The price of gas (and therefore, transactions) is dictated by the laws of supply and demand; if more people want to make transactions then the price of transactions will increase.

# I've heard it's expensive as fuck! What's being done?

This is probably Ethereum's largest criticism. It's no secret that the Ethereum blockchain is very expensive to use. It's important to recall that the only reason the blockchain is so expensive is because it's in such high demand.

This problem is being mitigated in a few ways:

1. Layer 2 solutions. These are other blockchains that are built on top of Ethereum that utilize it's security and decentralization. [They have fees that are much cheaper than the native blockchain.](https://l2fees.info/) But surprisingly, they're still not that cheap. Again - really high demand. The largest issue with Layer 2 solutions comes from the fact that they aren't widely accepted yet. Most exchanges don't support them natively, which means you would need to use an expensive bridge to move your funds over if you don't already use an exchange that supports them. The other issue with them is that there are many different L2's, and different dAPPS support different chains.
2. ETH2. This upgrade is frankly legendary. It's made up of a few different pieces. The first one is Ethereum's merge to Proof of Stake. I'll discuss it in more detail later. The more important piece for scaling is Sharding. Sharding allows us to seperate the blockchain into more managable pieces. This means that each node will only need to store a piece of the blockchain instead of the entire thing. This increases both speed and decentralization, it's an absolute no brainer.

# What makes Ethereum different then all the other chains?

Ethereum is extremely popular. This is one of the biggest benefits that Ethereum has over other blockchains. [On DefiPulse,](https://defipulse.com/) every single one of the top 128 DeFi projects run on Ethereum. **Every Single One.** It is by far the most popular and the most successful blockchain. It also consistently racks up much higher transaction volumes and network fees collected than even the big daddy Bitcoin.

# What's the merge to Proof of Stake all about?

Ethereum will merge from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This is currently estimated to occur in Q2 2022, but that may change. This change will:

1. Reduce Ethereum's energy usage by more than 99%. Since instead of mining, block proposers have to stake ETH, Ethereum's energy usage will fall by a huge amount. This is great because crypto projects are constantly targeted for their energy usage. Ethereum will be immune to this criticism.
2. Make block proposers accountable. In the current PoW system, if a miner attacks the blockchain they cannot be punished. Under PoS, they have staked their ETH into the network, which means it can be slashed if they misbehave. This improves security, as no sane person would attack a network that they have thousands of dollars staked in.
3. Allows for sharding. Sharding isn't currently possible on Proof of Work chains. Proof of Stake allows for this important upgrade.

# Okay, so Ethereum is great. But will it make me money?

Hell yes. The merge to PoS is probably the most bullish event in the entirety of crypto, in my opinion. Here is why. You may remember the EIP-1559 upgrade a few months ago that reduced the amount of ETH being issued by about 30%. Here's ETH's price leading up to this event:

[60&amp;#37; increase in 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/pn3ak1ycyf381.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc12b7c0c9305406a65ecb55d9322bcada7e8377)

You will notice a 60% increase in price in 2 weeks. Fucking wild.

This what happened when the ETH creation rate was reduced by 30%. Now brave yourself for this: **the merge to PoS will reduce emissions by 90%.** You can infer yourself how bullish you think this is, but I have no doubt it will be bullish as all fuck. If a 30% decrease in ETH creation is bullish enough for a 60% increase, a 90% decrease is going to be absolutely wild. The laws of supply and demand dictate that if supply decreases-as it will, because ETH will become deflationary-and demand remains constant, price MUST increase. This is a perfect storm of events for an absolute explosion in ETH's price.

# TL;DR

**Ethereum is the most popular smart contract blockchain by a mile. Its issues are being actively worked on by thousands of people all over the world who are very dedicated. Its merge to PoS is going to be one of the most bullish events ever. If a 30% decrease in ETH issuance causes a 60% increase in price, what do you think a 90% decrease in ETH issuance will cause? Ethereum has an amazing future, and so will you if you invest in it.**",CryptoCurrency

1. If your coins are stored on the blockchain, what does it matter if the centralized exchange you use goes bust?  If a CEX goes bust, can't you just validate the transation history on-chain to retain said ownership?  

2. If coins are stored on-chain, what is the point of hardware wallets besides keeping your seed phrase offline? Are hardware wallets actually ""depositing"" your coins onto exchanges, or are they just connecting them with blockchains under your identifiers to make a transaction? If so, what's actually happening when ""withdrawing"" your coins onto a hardware wallet?  

3. If I lend a sibling a car, I still have the pink slip, so ownership is not transferred. If I lend my coins to a protocol and it goes bust, why can't I get my coins back? Or is lending coins actually a tranferance of ownership of your coins on-chain (under pretense provided by said protocol)? If so are there alternatives where I can lend coins and actually retain ownership to prevent such an event from occurring?

t3_r8rzdr,Question about Brave browser (disappearing BAT),"Okay, moving on to the topic at hand. I've recently noticed that the revenue that appears in the ""BAT rewards"" tab is disappearing. Let's say - on Friday I have the browser open all day, ads pop up etc - I earn let's assume 0,35 BAT for this. I close the browser in the evening, next day I restart the computer and see that I have only 0,2 BAT in this tab.

The same happens on brave beta and nightly. On the company lapotp the same thing happens. Do you also have such situations? For me it is a little strange that after receiving BAT for displayed advertisement the next day it is taken away from me. Same with November payouts (where it says it will start in 4 days) yesterday it wrote that the payout will be much bigger than today.

Additionally, I have noticed that the amount of given BAT for each advertisement has changed - another blow, but I understand it. However, it is also strange that one day I normally get paid for them and the next day, for a few hours, even though the ads are displayed and appear - I do not have these payments.

t3_r8m5ow,this is how the market works,"If you are a newcomer and you are now panicking for this huge correction, i understand, but there are a few things you got to understand when it comes to crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Crypto is an algorithmic driven market. What does it mean? This means that around certain percentage of movements up and down, bots swarm and start buying and selling. Why is this important? Because the main narrative around crypto is about shilling and fud propaganda that aims to give false narrative to justify movements to illiterate wannabe traders and retail investors. The reality is that the market is programmed to have corrections around certain areas, to pump from certain targets, and every time influencers try to spread the narrative that a crash or a pump is due to this or that event, that is true only on very minimal part, and that's because of point 2.
2. Crypto is manipulated. Yes, it is, but not in the way you might understand: First i'll ask you a question that will give you a big insight on what is happening: When you enter a shop, who makes the price of the stuff? those who own the stuff. This is not different in crypto market. Whales are often the exchanges themselves: if you buy, they will do their best to devalue it to buy lower. If you sell, they will do their best to increase the value of what they have. This is all automated and co-ordinated. Add up one thing, the less you have and trade, the more the fees are. Big whales and exchanges can trade at 0 fees. So what does the narrative serve the whales? to justify big co-ordinated movements and scare you out of your coins or convince you to give them your fiat. It's the same for them, so if you trade thinking you can outsmart the market, you lose. You either believe in your coins or you value your fiat more. You have to decide and not let yourself be fooled into continuously changing your plans based on the narrative.
3. back to point 1: so why the social and real world events influence crypto market? Imagine you are nearing an area where the bots are not programmed to buy but to sell. The market will try naturally and automatically their best to go down. What whales do? They might start to buy artificially and pump alts to incentivize people into FOMOING, giving away fiat, which they need to pump important coins after the accumulation ends. Pumping BTC increase the FOMO and crypto adoption, and they make more money with more people buying in.That's why ANY good or bad event (a nation banning crypto, DOW JONES going down, covid, etcetera) is a perfect excuse for whales to let the market do it's course while blaming this or that event and not lose the face to the market. Especially new investors need to believe that the market is ALL natural and not programmed/manipulated, because, if so, whales will be exposed and people will be less gullible and prone to mistakes. and now we get to point 4:
4. Why is this knowledge so important to not be spread? because whales are in it for the profits. If more and more people understand how the market works, there's less and less people being fooled. Why doesn't traders tell you this stuff? because as whales they are in it for the money. The more people understand how the market works, the harder it gets to make money.
5. why do i tell you this stuff? Because i care about the technology more than it's price. I really think that the world finance WILL transition on crypto, and the more people understand how it works, the more the market will be stable and start to resemble the stock market. And this will be good. Once we will get out of the gold mine rush of a market full of people trying to scam each other, crypto WILL become the technology that will revolutionize the world.

So in short, if you want to make money, study how the market works. If you want Crypto to grow up of this phase of maniac and psychopath Scam industry and become the technology that can make the World a more fair and better place, LEARN HOW IT WORKS. Don't panic sell your coins, what goes up must go down, but the market as a whole will go up. But remember that VALUE and PRICE are two different things. The price that people today is willing to pay for a technology, it's not necessairly the value of it, and it's not written anywhere that it is how much it is going to cost in the future. As in the Dot-com bubble, internet was the revolution everyone was expecting, but 99% of the companies listed at first, failed miserably making a lot of people go bankrupt. Don't be gullible, have plans, don't go all in, don't invest more than you are willing to pay, but please, don't throw money at the machine like it is a slot machine, because this is not healthy for you and neither for the technology. Good luck and stay safe out there, stay focused on the big scheme.",CryptoCurrency

I do not think the crash is over and I also don't think the bull run is over. 

Obvious market manipulation right now. Large holdings are liquidated, new/ fearful investors panic and sell, this causes the ""crash"". What's next? In my opinion we will see one or two ""dead cat bounces"" before the last leg of the bull run. A dead cat bounce is when the market turns green after a large dump. This is where the people that want to sell right now but don't want to take such a loss will get all excited that the market is going up again, buy more if they can, and then when the large liquidations happen again, they will panic sell for an even larger dip.

How do I know this? Because it literally happens all the time. Bull runs attract new investors and everyone is high on gains. Whales know this and capitalize on it. For you to profit, someone else had to lose.

If you're the trading type, you can make some quick gains from these dead cat bounces but it's way too hard to predict bottoms and tops in my opinion. Personally, I'm not touching my long term holds and I pulled my yield farming/ trading funds out in anticipation for another 20%-30% crash in the coming month. 

I don't 100% understand all of the tax implications but as the year ends, some might intentionally sell at a loss to show that loss on their books and avoid capital gains. Then buyback in the new year. I may be misunderstanding that but I can still see that concept leading to more negative price movement.

In summation: the fundamentals of your favorite projects have not changed. If your original plan was to hold for ___ years then you're not even worried right now, right? Pick price targets and DCA more into your holdings if you can afford to. As for me, I genuinely think we'll see another 30% drop before year's end and I am planning accordingly.

# Crypto Market Insight: Don‚Äôt fall for FUD  

It‚Äôs a sea of red on the charts but hope remains in the form of strong buying at resistance levels. The Bitcoin bull market trendline has been broken with today‚Äôs candles close at 53k. This event will mark the first close below this important trendline. Price is coming down to test a strong resistance level between 52.5k and 54K indicated on the chart below. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are three possibilities that may occur here. 

1. Over the weekend price may rebound quickly enough to jump back into trend. 

2. Price could begin testing this resistance various times over the next week/s, setting bitcoin in a range. 

3. Prices break below the resistance to go test the next level at 50k. 

Today‚Äôs volume isn‚Äôt indicating a lot of strength which will favor a rebound off the resistance. The pin-bar candle noted on the 4-hour chart is reaffirming the strength of the resistance.

Funding rates are telling us that a cascade of selloffs will not occur due to liquidations in the derivatives. Volatility is increasing with this move and the consolidation we hoped for didn‚Äôt occur today. The down move is due to current macro climate. (Omnicron and FED-tapering news) 

**Stock Market**

Volume continues to be strong in stock market sell-off and yesterday‚Äôs rebound was short-lived. The topic of decoupling from stocks will have to be saved for another day. This market is dragging crypto with it. Stock market funds are moving into bonds out of fear. The VIX (Volatility Index) and fear gauge hit a new high of 35.32. Monday will tell us a lot about if this sell-off will continue in stocks. 

**Wrap-up**

Macroeconomic FUD is brining prices down, which is an emotional rection of the market. The current sentiment can dissipate quickly, and this would turn things around. There is little evidence of a major sell-off in crypto, so it‚Äôs recommended that you keep on hodling, watch the weekend prices and hope FUD dies down on Monday.

# NEWBIES‚Äô lesson of the day

**Controlling the fear during sell offs**

Cryptocurrencies are very volatile in nature and watching your money go down 10% in one day can be a scary event. You must remember that you can‚Äôt have 300% gains in a market without occasional 30-75% drawdowns. The price you pay for those gains is paid in resilience and patience. The last thing you want to do is to panic and sell to the traders that take advantage of fear in the markets. 

You must do your due diligence and research the projects you are putting your money into. If you truly believe in the technology and project, then holding on to losing positions is a lot easier. This is another reason not to invest heavily into meme coins. Read the news and see how much money is being invested into this market daily and see the hundreds of companies and banks maneuvering to get a piece of the pie. Crypto is here to stay. 

Get in the habit of selling when everyone is euphoric, which is incredibly hard. And buying when everyone else is fearful. Use the tools around you to help give you an edge. This is a large-scale game where others are trying to buy your investments at a lower price than you paid for it, don‚Äôt let have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great weekend everyone and remember to stack those sats!

My mom asked me to help her.           

**Regulation:** They are in the works, and ETF was just approved, others are continuously filing, there is movement and talk and deadlines, GG and the rest of them acknowledge cryptocurrencies as assets and promised to regulate them. With this movement comes progress even if it‚Äôs sideways.       

**Institutions:** Buying and holding BTC has become easier for retail investors, the availability of institutional-level infrastructure has eased their entry and they haven‚Äôt even started to really pour into this space yet. It‚Äôs growing daily, enticing global investors to keep their capital invested in the hardest assets they can find. There is a wall of institutional money waiting for regulations to be put into place so they can dump their cash reserves into this new asset class.           

**Inflation:** inflation is real. Inflation is not transitory. Inflation is probably higher than how they calculate it. This is a global issue for all countries and monetary systems. Bitcoin is the answer the the problem of inflation. You must store your wealth, your value, your energy, your time, your savings, in something that outpaces and exceeds the debasement of fiat money.         

**Sovereignty:** Cryptos now can challenge the primacy of the state and its monopoly on creating, printing and control of legal tender.         

**Anarchism:** In a sense, ‚Äúbitcoin is the spearhead of a particularly extreme form of libertarian anarchism‚Äù where cryptographically protected anonymization technologies, digital pseudonyms, and digital money are used to circumvent state control - surveillance, censorship, and taxation.

In this bull market Bitcoin touched an ATH in april and then crashed in May. We had a boring summer where bitcoin touched the bottom of 29k. And even after all of that we managed to break ATH from april and we hit 69k.

This is just crypto, either you gonna learn, gain experience and become veteran or you will lose and end your crypto journey. If you are too afraid to buy, at least don't panic sell. Close charts, leave reddit for few days and do something else. Don't spread FUD.


Remember  also that last time for example  BTC was for $47k was... Litterally just 2 months ago,  in the beginning of the September, so although today it is great buying opportunity if you wanted to buy in December, do not  become overjoyed. It is just -20% off, no need to sell your  kidney to buy crypto. Buy if you have free money and wanted to buy in near time anyway this is good time. Do not buy if you didn't wanted to buy 2/3 months ago for the same price. Always look at bigger picture, zoom out. 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day or 1 week charts are not good to check market trends. Look at 1 month, 3 months or 1 year charts. Crypto is not crashing, if you bought more than few months ago you are still in huge profit. If you bought few days or weeks ago be patient. Wait 6 months or 1 year before you will start complaining about recenly bought investments.",CryptoCurrency
t3_r8nfec,"NEXUS ASA, the Algorand asset that lets players buy, sell, swap and trade online game currency.","Hey everyone,

I've been following this project for a few weeks and I thought r/CryptoCurrency might like to check it out.

Nexus is an Algorand Standard Asset that is service based towards players of online video games like MMORPG's and CS:GO. It's a zero fee service that allows these players to advertise if they want to swap in-game currency from one game to another. Their project lead is also super transparent about pretty much everything. u/gregorymyllama

Like, if I got bored of playing World of Warcraft, I could use nexus to swap my currency over to Guild Wars 2. Or sell it to another player.

I like the idea of the project, because it helps to combat bots in the games. If nobody is buying the gold off the shady websites, that will lead to no bots in that game.

**Benefits of using Nexus:**

* No risk of getting banned from the game
* No entering credit card information into sketchy RMT websites
* Player to player exchange
* Insurance for the trades (ain't nobody going to scam)

NEXUS was just verified by the Algo Explorer team today. If you guys want to check them out, you can visit their subreddit r/NexusASA

They also have a faucet at Algodrops. (I would link it but I don't think r/cc likes links)

The Nexus website is posted to the subreddit also!

What do you guys think about this? Is this a service that online gamers should take advantage of?",CryptoCurrency

But I decided not to panic, firstly because I had invested money I could afford to lose with some part left in stablecoins, and secondly because I knew at some point in time we will be back up. So what did I do?

Well I started DCAing, every month a small amounts, plus I was buying every time we dipped more than 10%. No emotions, just follow my plan as a machine: buy every first day of the month and always have buy orders at 10%, 20% and 30% lower than the current price.

The result? My portfolio is still happy in green, even though I haven't bought a single of the coins that did +100000000% gains in the last months. Mainly BTC, ETH, and small chunks of ALGO, XTZ, and VET.

This just put the market into extreme fear, so it can be an incredible buy opportunity. If the FOLO will drive the price action lower, then its quite obviously panic selling.

I can imagine to expect news of ""XYZ"" company or El Salvador buying a ton of BTC soon.

I personally thought that the incredible buy was in range of 51-53k, before we went up to 58k. Got burned a little but that is just the market. Someone wanted to cash out a good chunk and it triggered this drop.

Bitcoin still has potential to go 100k in the coming months. Once we get a massive volume candle up people will rally. It always works both ways.

Don‚Äôt worry about missing out, don‚Äôt think that because you don‚Äôt have enough cash right now to buy the dip that you have missed out on a huge opportunity. These kinds of opportunities come and go, and you‚Äôll probably notice a lot of coins will fall and rise at different rates. Don‚Äôt start taking out loans and racking up credit card debts to jump in on the opportunity, everyone here invests as much as they can and if you‚Äôre all out, that‚Äôs fine.

t3_r8rvea,"I've added Kucoin support to my new listings crypto trading bot and the test results look promising, the code is open sourced","The idea itself is quite simple, the trading bot scans the Binance (and now Kucoin too) announcement page, and once a new listing announcement has been detected, it proceeds to trade this on gateio.

I chose gateio because they are more relaxed with coin listing, although they're janky af. This means that what Kucoin and Binance WILL list, is probably already listed on there.

Last month, I shared an update with you regarding this tool and I was really excited that the tool has actually made some money to some of the people using it.

However, the speed of execution differs a lot between one country or another, which means that it either needs to un on a VPS in Tokyo, or you have to get lucky to get in early enough.

That's mainly due to the fact that Binance is highly competitive when it comes to new listings, and it's most likely overbotted.

Another downside of the bot running exclusively on Binance is that we only get 1-3  listings a week which means there's a lot of downtime.

**Adding Kucoin announcement support would therefore solve two issues:**

*  Operating in a less competitive market, means we don't need to worry about the speed of execution as much.
* More coin listings means more opportunities to make (or lose) money.

Thanks to user busyuqboy, I have some initial test data that shows that by introducing Kucoin support to this trading bot, it seems that the tool would be consistently profitable:

KIN was bought between 7.6 and 8.5 seconds, after the announcement was made on Kucoin, depending on where the VPS was located:

SRM was detected and bought in 7.2 seconds from Barhain VPS and 4.8 seconds on the N. Virginia VPS.

So, any who. We are approaching a new year in crypto and I want to discuss everyones‚Äô investing strategy for 2022. I got into crypto almost a year ago. I started investing in February and tried out different exchanges, different coins, cold wallets, (and learned about the insane Eth-gas fee‚Äôs).

I‚Äôm finishing university now in late December and I will have a fairly well paid job starting in mid January.

‚Ä¢ The last of every month I Will invest ‚âà $50 USD every month in each of the top 10 coins. I will continue to do this every month no matter the price.

‚Ä¢ I invest ‚âà $12,50 USD every week in the top 10 coins. This strategy feels a little funnier because It allows me to be more active. Btw, is there any data on which of the weekdays crypto usually dips?

‚Ä¢ I invest ‚âà $50 USD every moth in 10 coins of my choice. Right now I‚Äôm thinking of BTC, ETH, SOL, Terra, Cro, Algo, Chainlink, Cosmos, Stellar, Sandbox. If I choose this I can also decide to invest $12,50 USD once a week. But then again. I would like to have some data for which day it‚Äôs best to invest.

So what strategy do you think sounds best? What‚Äôs your strategy going into 2022? Is there any day in the month or the week that it's statistically better to invest on? Did Jeffrey Epstein really kill himself? How can Pete Davidsson date all those women?

I thought these values are based (out of thin Air
Mostly) individually on their projects or visions or whatever word salad crap that gets put on on their mysterious websites. 

Which leads me to my next question. How are these coin values established sec by sec.  What information/actions/whatever dictate the ticker moving non stop for all eternity. I grasp how value is established based on‚Ä¶ coin availability‚Ä¶ money invested‚Ä¶ prospective gains from projects or visions. But what is all this twitch movement based off of sec by second. 

And i got one more for now

I hear how most coins have a set amount in circulation. Some have burns which I understand that. And those are factors in the value. But this is me trying to understand the reality concrete part of it. Let‚Äôs use a fake example with oversimplified numbers for my questions sake‚Ä¶. but represent a very real and common scenario‚Ä¶


BOTcoin is very strong and popular. They are a pioneer in crypto and have continued to stay relevant in the crypto game. Coin valued at $100 usd and showing steady gains throughout the coins history. The total coins minted are listed at  10 mil and states a burn of 1 mil early on and lists a circulation of 9 mil coins. 

This is where I am trying to intertwine crypto with the coin jar on my shelf. If I want to get into owning botcoin and I haven‚Äôt before. We know  the 9 mil in circulation number. So when I decide to purchase 100 coins. Whose 100 were they and did someone allow their 100 to be mine? But where did the $$$ go that my debit card sent to coinbase to then produce 100 coins and state I‚Äôm the owner. I‚Äôm really confused to the actual coins location bc when putting a number on circulation you are telling me there is an exact amount of coins in their own respected owners locations. So is every coin distributed and bought by exchanges kept in their vaults and then sold to whoever purchases it. Bc every coin that gets bought from fiat has to have a service,exchange, app, whatever serve as the facilitator/transporter of the coins. But where are the coins coming from that coinbase or crypto dot come are purchasing on behalf of their members????

I see this as a potential opportunity to borrow USDT to buy coins and then if it‚Äôs value goes south pay off the left over debt for a fraction however would be interesting to see if the rates skyrocket on it like eg a hyper inflation currency that loses peg against the USD like Zimbabwe years ago.

t3_r8q7bj,Crash Theory - Capital Gains Tax,"This bull run really kicked off in late November of 2020. I have a feeling that a lot of whales in the US purchased around this time as they saw a huge buying opportunity. 

In the United States, gains are taxed in two ways: long term, and short term. Short term gains are from any position closed within one year and are taxed at a higher rate (think 25%). Long term gains are from a position closed after more than one year and are taxed at a lower rate (think 15%). 

If you had made a multi million dollar purchase of Bitcoin at $20k (roughly the price at the end of November/early December), you‚Äôd have to pay hundreds of thousands in taxes when you eventually sell due to the rise in price. Waiting until your position is qualified as long term would save you a small fortune. 

This flash crash occurred almost exactly at 12:00 am NY time as if it was a meticulously planned strategy. 

This could easily be what‚Äôs causing some selling as we are now past the one year mark for this current bull run.

Next time your coins hit the funny number, just sell it, because 69 will always be the top. If your coins goes above it, then multiply your target by 10. So for example the top for Solana will be at 690$, not 69$, as we went past it.

Not only do the highly leveraged Perpetual Swaps contribute to, or even cause, boom and bust cycles in crypto, they are also a big part of why nearly all established cryptos pull back when BTC pulls back in price.

t3_r90f78,What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts on PAXG?,"PAX Gold (PAXG) is an ERC-20 token (meaning it is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and other
networks that are based on Ethereum) that is pegged to one troy ounce of a 400-ounce London Gold Delivery
gold bar. Holders of PAXG tokens actually own the underlying asset, which is held by the Paxos Trust Co, and
which can be redeemed at any point.
PAXG price tracks the price of the gold it represents, which is subject to changing market conditions. The toker
seeks to make purchasing gold bullion easier, faster and more accessible through fractional ownership.
PAXG Price
Paxos Trust introduced PAX Gold in September 2019. Unlike with many cryptocurrencies, there is no maximum
supply for the asset because Paxos Trust can issue as many tokens as demand requires,
Issuance of PAXG is subject to market demand for the gold-backed token and is not subjected to a fixed
schedule. When a user redeems a PAXG token for physical gold, the corresponding PAX Gold token is burned
immediately.
Because PAXG's value is based on the price of gold, it sees regular ups and downs, Although gold is considered
a store of value, its price momentum has yielded ups and downs over the years. PAX Gold spiked to over $2,000
in January 2021 before tumbling to just below $1,700 in late February 2021. A new surge occurred in May 2021,
with the token reaching an all-time high value of $2,155.11 on May 17.
How Does PAX Gold Work?
Every PAXG token is backed by one ounce of allocated gold stored in Brink's vaults. For smaller amounts,
physical gold retailers are used to help investors redeem their tokens.
PAX uses the same consensus protocol and blockchain features as Ethereum, including access to smart
contracts.",CryptoCurrency

Try to (learn to) let go,"Red numbers everywhere, portfolio looking like shit, redditors telling you ""buy dip buy dip buy dip lol"" when you don't have the money to do so, redditors telling you ""lole you stressers are stoopid i just buy"", other crypto (social) media stressing you out. There's a decent chance that you might be a bit worked up over it all. If that's you, try these four tips below and just try to let go for a bit.

- The first thing you should understand is that this crash or dip or dump, or whatever you want to call it, is out of your control. Nothing you can possibly do will change any of it. Therefore, the best thing to do is absolutely nothing whatsoever.
- Second, being worried or anxious or feeling anything else over this is mostly pointless. Again, all of this is outside of your control. Feeling worried over something you cannot control is human, but pointless. Worry over things in life that you do have control over and focus your energy on dealing with these things. It will both help your mind focus on something else and dealing with other issues will make you feel better.
- Third, some practical advice: looking at the charts/markets is not going to help you. I would advise you to set a reminder for a price level that you are comfortable with and then close your browsers/apps and go do other things. And not just do other things for an hour or two, because then you'll be right back at watching the charts and right back where you are now. That's probably not how fast the market will recover (but it will recover). Go do other things for a few days. Meet some friends, read books, go fix whatever worries are withing your control.
- Fourth, I can't stress this enough: let it go, Elsa. That's not just crypto advice, that's life advice. Everything that you cannot control is not worth stressing over, so don't.

Like anything, you're not going to learn this overnight. Just keep in mind that stress is stupid, annoying, useless and unhealthy. You want as little of it in life as possible. Eventually you'll teach your brain to worry less.

I put my phone down and tried my best to think clearly and logically. Throwing all emotion out the door. 

I am no vet but I am also not an amateur. I have been holding full coins of BTC, ETH, and LTC since May 2017. This is not a brag on newbies, this is mental advice for all. Understand the insane ride I and many others have been on. This is to point out what I did and why when I saw BTC go from 2k to roughly 20k and then nosedive into a long cold hibernation years ago. 

Back then seeing 2k of BTC turn to 20k made me feel strong, smart, and just simply happy. It wasn‚Äôt life changing money but it was a lot to me and still is. But when that 20k did a nosedive and plummeted into a long cold hibernation I didn‚Äôt feel weak, dumb, and unhappy. I actually had one emotion and it was the only emotion I had subtly throughout the entire ride. That emotion was frustration. I was frustrated the ride up for not buying more and I had this same feeling riding the wave down watching all my gains burn.

Now think. Only one of those I can control and that‚Äôs the ride up - buying more. Sure you can say sell before watching it all go down. But that won‚Äôt fix anything for the ride (back) up, it‚Äôll do the opposite. You‚Äôll be really frustrated because now you have nothing to watch go up. So I took my only long term emotion of frustration by the fucking balls and BOUGHT MORE during this time. 

Last night I zoomed out, looked how far we‚Äôve come, and bought the fire sale of alt coins and also averaged some down. This is the same thing I did when BTC, ETH, and LTC had their little fire sale in 2019 after it‚Äôs old ATH.

t3_r8wyps,We need to decouple the fuck out of Bitcoin cause it's inferior to the rest of the blockchains both technologically and environmentally and it drags the rest of crypto needlessly down when it takes a 10k$/h dive!,"I mean the title says it all. Sure, we can all argue that we're still too fucking early and no matter the 2 trillion market cap, this is actually true. We're still in the infancy phase and that's true for most top 10 blockchains including Ethereum, Cardano, Solana...

Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto is coupled cause everything's paired with BTC and sometimes it's the only pairing even though Bitcoin is both technologically and environmentally inferior to most cryptos  that came after it, it still dictates the price movements of nearly everything. When the FIAT value of  BTC rises, most of other crypto seem to rise too. When grandpa BTC falls, almost every other crypto seems to take a similar even amplified beating!

BTC falls, crypto paired with BTC will fall in FIAT-value even if they have other pairings. This is because, normally, its BTC pairs would boast the highest trade volume.

So, while everyone is focused on BTC going to 1M/BTC, I can almost certainly predict that the grandpa will fail 5-10 years from and finally will be overtaken by other current top 10 crypto with strong use case like Etehreum, Cardano, Solana and hell even XRP Ledger!

t3_r8wwem,A possible gem (need your opinion)?,"# 1. Unpopularity of options in DeFi

Okay, so we all know that Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap have been very successful in DeFi. But it always occured to me why we don't have similarly famous options markets for cryptocurrencies. Well, it turns out options aren't as much popular in crypto because options (especially option selling) is a very, very risky business considering that crypto is already extremely volatile. Unless you allow Market Makers (MMs) a safe way to sell options on crypto, they will demand a way higher premium compared to Traditional Finance (TradFi). The reason why selling options against crypto that you hold is risky is that there is a very large probability you will lose everything (-100% drawdown possibility), and in TradFi people use the Black Scholes model (an Nobel prize winning tool) to price options that they want to sell in such a way so as to stay profitable. But the thing is, this model does not work for very volatile assets like cryptos.

My hypothesis is that this high premium is precisely why options are having a hard time to gain adoption (by, say, the crowd over at r/wsb for example).

# 2. Lack of ""Institutional Adoption"" of DeFi

Okay, so we all know Institutional Adoption is a meme (at least for the most part). But have you ever thought of why that is? Well, one reason is the lack of financial instruments that these institutional players are so used to in TradFi. One such instrument is hedging (via options). Now, you can't hedge your crypto positions by purchasing options if you don't have a seller on the other side willing to sell you those options at a reasonable premium in the first place (i.e. the problem of liquidity).

So, if you solve problem #1 of optimal options pricing with reasonable premiums, you effectively solve problem #2 of liquidity.

# 3. Enter PotionLabs
(*No, I have nothing to do with them neither do I hold any bags. Because, well I can't... not yet anyway*)

I've recently stumbled upon what seems to be a true crypto gem (at least that's what I think so). The guys over at @PotionLabs have effectively solved problem #1 with something they call the ""Kelly Machine"" that, apparently, outperforms the Black Scholes model in TradFi (this is huge imo!). They use a math tool called the Kelly Criterion (used to determine optimal bet size for maximum gains) and turned it on its head to instead calculate optimal premium for selling options. And it works even for extremely volatile assets like crypto!

*TLDR* --- they are effectively a Uniswap but for options (well, kind of but not exactly)!

# 3. That's all good, but what's the ticker?

There is none. They don't have a token nor do they intend to ever have one. Instead, they plan to have 10k governance NFTs on auction and the Dapp will launch in January next year.

# 4. Okay, so what do you want from this sub?

I want a second opinion (or maybe some confiation bias lol). Obviously, if it isn't already obvious from the post, I'm excited about potion. But I want to see if this is just my wishful thinking or is there really something legit here. By all means, please rip my DD to shreds. I'll be thankful for it!

Then buy it back if it dips below 25% from what you sold for. If a coin really gains x100 you won't make as big of a profit, but so far I have more crypto than I would have had by just holding.

t3_r8qb3y,"Most likely I‚Äôm wrong, but was institutionalized investing + major whales responsible for this correction?","
Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt know jack shit about cryptocurrency and I‚Äôm a horrible investor given that my portfolio is very red at the moment. However this week, has been informative for me in learning about defi 2.0 - OlympusDao and TIME wonderland. Same thing with me opening a position with UST on Anchor Protocol 20% apy Earn.

While thinking about how Bitcoin broke the 21 week EMA and dropped below 52k, then shot down to 42k to only find legs at 48k a random thought popped up into my head. Why ?

The most surprising part of the crash was that it didn‚Äôt happen during normal business hours (when does it ever)
in America. It didn‚Äôt happen as US stocks have been going down during open/ after hours for the last 2-3 weeks. It didn‚Äôt happen as leaders of the crypto community like Sam Bankman Fried (founder of FTX/ Alameda Research) are going to meet with government regulatory board to m discuss stablecoins this month. Sure Crypto has been going down since November 9th but how did it lose 9-15 thousand dollars in a matter of hours/2 days?

 I‚Äôm just gonna throw this out there, I believe this was a deliberate sell off by institutionalized investors + major whales. The sell wall at 69k was too great for BTc to continue to run without government oversight. In my opinion, a short retest of 40k was bound to happen after JPowell mentioned the possibility of raising interest rates, Evergrande Fud, Charlie Munger Fud, inflation disarray, stablecoin regulation, and of course our deadly foes delta+OMi. 

One thing i know is BTc and eth will hit new highs come 2022. Strap yourself in boys, it‚Äôs gonna be a bumpy ride but there‚Äôs no denying blockchains are here to stay.

t3_r8q1a0,Reflections during correction/crashes,"Not an old crypto soul here, but even a short time teaches you a lot about volatility. 

Here are some observations while navigating through rough, red seas.  

1. The ‚Äùexperts‚Äù are often wrong because there are no experts. 

Remember Plan B‚Äôs predictions for Bitcoin price? It was all the rage as if he had some magical time machine and could see the future Nov. $89K, Dec $100K blah, blah, blah. These pseudo-science ‚Äúexperts‚Äù will return again when things turn around to peddle more snake oil. Just remember how often they‚Äôve been wrong when they seem to be right (selection bias).

2. Portfolio diversification

I‚Äôm as guilty as the rest thinking I can spread risk across multiple crypto sectors. When the markets turn red though it‚Äôs clear there is no protection (unless you‚Äôve socked away some gains into stable coins.) The curves all look the same with alts generally getting hit harder than BTC, especially the smaller market caps. 

What holding in different sectors does (blockchain, layer 2‚Äôs, defi, gaming, oracles, etc.) is catch different waves on the upside. There are rotations across sectors and even within them as money seeks gains when they flatten elsewhere. 

When BTC sinks in any major way, pretty much everything sinks along with it (e.g. the entire top 100 are in the red. )

3. Better understand risk and risk tolerance

Down markets really challenge one‚Äôs approach to crypto, but one thing is certain‚Äî this is not a test of your diamond vs paper hands or any other egoist bullshit. 

It‚Äôs your money and no anonymous shit-poster on a website chat platform has your interests at heart. 

Know this deep in your bones. 

A sea of red does challenge assumptions about risk, too. Is the drop making you feel uneasy, sick to your stomach, losing sleep, excited to jump in with more hard-earned money because everything looks cheap (it may or may not be)? Did you panic sell because you needed it to pay for something short-term and you thought you could make some quick money?

Have you even noticed the prices drop or are you buying some every week/month to DCA and will for the next ten years so you don‚Äôt care?

All of this points to understanding the risks (how much and how fast prices can drop with no warning) and your personal risk tolerance. 

4. Time-frame 

(Yes, in the long run we‚Äôre all dead, but until then there‚Äôs a lot of living to do.)

A crash really highlights the value of longer time horizons. Investments in a new technology sector, a financial revolution, a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of shared benefit, is going to be a rocky road. 

How many railroad companies went bankrupt even though the steam engine revolutionized transport or tech companies all chasing internet gold? A lot. Most even. 

It‚Äôs impossible to know 100% which ones will succeed, but there are educated guesses. Doing some research is important, especially during down markets.

t3_r8m3qs,So you wanna leverage trade huh? How to get absolutely rekt.,"THIS POST IS DESIGNED TO EMPHASISE HOW DANGEROUS LEVERAGE TRADING IS!!! 

So when I got into crypto I had no idea what margin trading involved, but I knew from the degeneracy I'd seen on the internet that people either made absolute bank or got rekt into oblivion. This is a post going through the BARE basics of what margin trading is (stuff I wish someone had told me!). There's obviously a lot more to it and I'd love if people could contribute in the comments or advise me of any inaccuracies in my post. This post was inspired by u/YuzuDaddy's post today. 


People are getting liquidated ‚Äì what the f\*\*k does that mean?

&amp;#x200B;

**Firstly ‚Äì what is margin trading?**

At its core you are borrowing funds and providing collateral at a specific ration. For example, if you want to open a deal for $10,000 with a 10:1 leverage you need to open a position with $1000 of your own capital.

**What positions can you hold?**

Simple: long or short

Long position = You expect to make $$$ from growth in the asset‚Äôs price

Short position = You expect to make $$$ from the decrease in the asset‚Äôs price

**How does this work?**

Say for example you open a long position on ETH with $1000, with a 10:1 leverage. Because of your leverage if the price rises by 1% the profit would be $100. Without leverage your profit would have been $10. Tempting right? No, this is how people YOLO their savings and get destroyed.

**How do you get rekt leverage trading?**

By the liquidation price. This describes the price at which your funds would be liquidated. This is multi-factorial and depends on your position (long vs short), the leverage and the amount of funds sitting in your account.

Profit or Loss = Initial margin x %price movement x leverage

**Getting liquidated**

Liquidation % = 100/Leverage

Say you invest $100 in ADA and then use 5x leverage on your position. This means that you will be borrowing $400 to increase your trading position to $500. Say in this example the price of ADA rises by 20% - this means that your profit is now $100 (compared to $20 if you had not participated in leverage trading).

In the above example with 5x leverage your collateral will become liquidated and the exchange will forcibly close your position if the price of ADA moves 20% against your position.

**How do people avoid getting liquidated (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DYOR)**

In general by establishing a stop loss ‚Äì this instructs the exchange to sell the asset when a particular price.

3 things are considered:

1. Stop price
2. Sell price
3. Size of asset sold

Example: Your account has $5000. Say you have an initial margin of $3000 and open a position with 3x leverage to create a position of $9000 which you place entirely in SOL. By placing a stop loss at 2% from the entry position. In this instance you would lose $180, representing 3.6% of their account size.

Dear [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/)cc family,

For my master thesis in behavioural finance, I am conducting a **study on cognitive biases in cryptocurrency investors, with the moderating role of Reddit in mind.**

In order to test my hypothesis and research questions, I need data, and [I have designed this short survey for that purpose.](https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2) It will take you approximately 10 minutes to fill in.

**NO personal identity data will be asked for, nor collected (no names, email address etc).**

The topic of cognitive biases in retail cryptocurrency investors and the moderating role of social media in driving these biases remains a vastly under-researched topic (unfortunately). I believe this topic to be extremely relevant today, especially in such a high frequency market as cryptocurrencies. This is your chance to help participate in filling this crucial research gap.

[You can find the survey here.](https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2)

Please feel free to share it in your circles: the more respondents, the more data, and the more accurate the statistical results will be.

I will of course be posting my concluded thesis once it is completed, so that anyone interested in the results can read it.

If you do decide to participate in the survey, please carefully read the indications, questions, and please answer as accurately as possible.

Thank you all very much in advance for helping advance scientific research in cryptocurrencies and investor behaviour!!!

*Let me know in the comments if you have participated in the survey to enter the raffle for 100 moon reward (and please be honest)*

Edit 1: thank you so much everyone for the feedback, participation, kind words, awards and encouragement! It warms my heart! I am taking a small break from reddit to enjoy dinner, and will keep on replying to everyone later tonight. For anyone wondering - i will be posting the results along with my finished research paper around January, once I have completed my defence of my thesis! Thank you all again!

I will most likely make a proper post out of it, highlighting the key results, but in case you don't want to miss it, you can use the ""remind me!"" bot in the comments to this post, as I will also add the link to my results post in this post.

t3_r8fzld,Why the Dip is Bothering You.,"1. You think crypto is a quick get rich scheme. It is a get rich scheme but not a quick one*. (*unless you get lucky and your coin gets chosen by a pump and dump group OR your coin is subject to actual institutional use, you won't get rich quickly). 

2. You think you are in a casino and expect results immediately. In a casino the odds are against you and the chances of losing everything is astronomically high. I have learned that unless you don't do any research and invest in shit coins, yout chances of losing everything in crypto is almost 0. 

3. You have never invested before. This is your first time. Popping your investment cherry **via** crypto by getting in somewhere in the middle or the top of a bullrun is like losing your virginity to someone you were never interested in but you did it anyway because you didn't know what you were doing, you didn't really think it through, and didn't expect the **post-nut** clarity to hit so hard. 

4. You invested way more than you thought you could afford to lose. 

5. You didn't price average. You went all in and gave 0 cash to buy anymore.

6. You never cared about the technology in the first place. Because if you did, why would you care if the price is going down? 

7. You didn't do any research. And you never zoomed out. 

8. You didn't diversify. 

9. You didn't buy any BTC or ETH. Whenever there is a BTC dip, all alts ***usually*** dip twice or three times worse. Ethereum usually drops the least due to a BTC sell off. So if you don't want to hold any BTC, consider ETH instead. 

10. You are putting a lot of your hopes in crypto. Man, this is the saddest thing I see again and again on this sub. So many people make posts here saying: 

&gt; before crypto I thought I would work until I was lowered into my casket. But now? Man, I have hope that I won't. 

This is great and all and I'm glad crypto is giving you hope, but if a temporary dip is bothering you, you have bigger problems you need to resolve. It is like getting into a relationship while being depressed and expecting having a partner to fix your emotional problems. I don't blame anyone for doing this. Just stating an observation.


11. You never had an exit strategy and watched the price skyrocket and then plummet. If you don't have one, then make one. 

------

In short, find out at what price will you cash out. Let's say you bought BTC at $69000. If you are on an exchange put a sell order at $1,000,000 and uninstall your CEX app. It might hit the price you will sell it, it might not. Everything in between doesn't matter. If you don't want to use an exchange, then get portfolio tracker and put a price alert for when you will sell. Then transfer your crypto to your own wallet and unsubscribe from any subreddit that gives you anxiety. 


If none of this bothers you, welcome to the club. Sit back, use your reserve cash to buy more to average down if you didn't go all in, and then enjoy the ride.",CryptoCurrency

The news rocked the bitcoin world, and news outlets allover the world said it could even bring down the much-hyped digital currency forever... 

Mt. Gox was a messy combination of poor management, neglect, and raw inexperience. It was initially created by XRP co founder Jed McCaleb in 2010, sold to Mark Karpeles in March 2011 who was a big reason for the rise and uktimate failure of the exchange.

ETH/BTC ratio is up +3% in the last 24h and the market cap of ETH is 52% of BTC market cap.

All this is extremely bullish for ETH, and the merge which will make ETH become deflationary is just a few months away. It will likely be in the middle of a bear market late next year (if history repeats) and it will be interesting to see if it will trigger a bullrun like BTC halvings usually do, as its effects on ETH supply will be a lot stronger than a BTC halvings effects on BTC supply.

After I checked Reddit out for some minutes. I saw all those ""CRAAAAAASH"" posts. So I wanted to check the two big ones out ETH and BTC.  

**BTC** dipped to the time I'm writing this to **47K** this price we had seen before **two Months.**

**ETH to 3.9K** was also last seen before **two months**.

t3_r8utt4,ETH and BTC showing their true strength,"Yes this is another of those posts discussing the price drop. 

For anyone new or freaking out pls zoom out at a year trend. Annual cycles are crucial to understand in crypto, like in any complex time series. 

ETH: Showed massive resistance and still stays at a positive slope that allows for rapid growth of value. 

BTC: Although it didn't have the same resistance as ETH and its current annual trend doesn't show signs of rapid growth, it shows long term stubbornness. Meaning that it's starting to have a baseline people can depend on.

What does this mean?
This makes sense given the room ETH has to grow with meta verse and defi. 
BTC also makes sense given it's primary utility of being store of value. Less variability and more stubbornness makes it easy to have it be comparable to a gold standard. 
ETH and BTC are in different phases so if you plan to invest, try to understand them independently. But both of them do show promise of long term growth but it would need a phase shift in it's cyclical dynamics to take it to the next level, which is healthy in complex systems....so good news.",CryptoCurrency

My point there is we love to try and time the market even tho WE ALL KNOW THAT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE smh**

people have this bull/ bear thing all chopped and confused... we are in the bull still its just a dip...

the bear is a giant drop with no short term jump back up ... so if we have a big drop like right now and then the prices just keep slowly dropping with no upside for a while THEN THATS A BEAR MARKET

if shit just dips 20% 40% and then goes back up in a week or 3 weeks then that was just a nice fire sale dip

i remember when ETH was about 1500$ and we had a flash crash to 800$ everybody was selling but it jumped back up in about a few hours and people felt stupid af ( just an example of bad decisions based on this stupid BULL/BEAR shit )

t3_r8us4k,This Is What Happened and This Is Why I Bought the Dip,"It's been a crazy past few days in both the stock and crypto markets and in my opinion, this is what‚Äôs been happening:

1 - Stock market corrected due to overall extension of valuations + Powell comments on inflation no longer transitory, faster tapering, and rise in interest rates. This especially hurts high growth stocks in particular which saw the steepest declines

2- The above plus omicron spooked investors and created uncertainty (which investors HATE) due to countries shutting down travel which slows down economic recovery and exacerbates supply chain 

3- Crypto markets were doing just fine until earlier today where everything started to tank. Crypto markets are still tied to macroeconomic effects in my view and so the effects of the stock market bled into crypto 

4- As a result crypto started to fall, and I don‚Äôt have access to the data but in the past what has happened is funds that were over leveraged get liquidated once prices fall and that happens exponentially as prices fall more which is why i think crypto instantly fell 20% across the board 

5 - As a result I think this liquidation provides a good discount in the crypto markets and I‚Äôve personally added to my positions (SOL, LUNA, ATOM, AVAX)

Finally, if you really need the hopium, take a chart and draw the prices bouncing back up as fast as they went down and reaching ATH by EOY.

This is one of my favorite Warren Buffet quotes. I think it perfectly applies to the crypto market right now. We all know (if you truly believe in the fundamentals) that over a long enough timeframe, the market will trend up. So if you liked something when it was expensive, shouldn't you like it even more when it's cheap? If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions. 

The ones who truly make life changing gains are the ones with true conviction, who keep buying when there's blood on the streets. I know it's a meme but you gotta truly be ""in it for the tech"". You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of selling at the wrong time and miss out on the massive inevitable recovery like many will. Investing is all about having a longer time preference. DCA is always the best strategy starting out.

t3_r8izi5,Some perspective my friends!,"Listen, this is going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some tips I‚Äôve learned over the last 1.5 years.

1. Make time goals: mine is 10 years, it‚Äôs easier said than done but really zoom out and if you can look further out this is normal.

2. Don‚Äôt worry about Bull and Bear markets. Just DCA and hold. Any time I‚Äôve traded, it‚Äôs never worked out well.

3. The most gains I have made was when there was blood in the streets‚Ä¶this last July, every coin I bought is up. Ethereum at 1700.00, BTC at 30K, Dot at 15.00, Link at 16.00. In a years time you will thank yourself for DCA and Hold.

4. Don‚Äôt get caught up in ‚ÄúBuying the Dip‚Äù because you are trying to catch a falling knife, DCA and hold, you will buy the bottom.

5. Don‚Äôt EVER buy crypto with money you NEED, it will consume you, you won‚Äôt sleep looking at RED and knowing you took a loan out for crypto, or used savings for crypto. I stopped my 401k last year and every 2 weeks I use 10% of my net pay. Honestly since then I hardly ever check the charts. When is the last time you feverishly checked your 401k 20 times a day.

6. If you are RED and really stressed, just remember to remind yourself why you got into this. Write your goals down, on a white board, post them on a wall, something you can see every day and remember you are working towards it. 

7. If your thoughts are dark, reach out to someone‚Ä¶",CryptoCurrency

Now if you are in a state of fear, the best thing you can do is to take a step back. There is absolutely no place for panic decisions, especially cutting losses with a holding that you have great trust in.

t3_r8pl8c,"Dips, crashes and lessons learned","So, now that the market is heavily going down some new investors may feel like they made the biggest mistake of their lives. I started investing a year ago and I know what you're feeling right now.

Lesson number 1
Is this a big dip? Is this a crash? Nobody knows, and the only way to protect your money is to HODL because prices will go back up. If you start trading thinking you know what you're doing you're going to lose money, almost guaranteed.

Lesson number 2
Do not, and I can't stress this enough, do what other people tell you to do. The ""experts"" make predictions every day and most of the time they are wrong. And if the ""experts"" get it wrong, listening to reddit will certainly not be a better idea. You see projects that you think will have value in the future? Go for them. Do not buy every coin that this sub thinks will moon or you will lose money. 

Lesson number 3
Invest most of your money in solid and proven projects like ETH and BTC that you know will still be there in the future. If you put the majority of your assets in a risky investment thinking you will become rich in 2 weeks you will likely lose money. The key is to diversify. 

Lesson number 4
DO buy shitcoins. They are a way to make a lot of money out of nothing and these opportunities will not last forever. 
Putting all your money into them is incredibly stupid because most of them will fail but you should choose a number of them that you think are actually solid projects or that have the potential to moon.

Lesson number 5
Stop looking at charts, they will only give you anxiety and there's nothing you can do to effectively time the market. If you can spare enough money you should DCA during the month, otherwise invest when you have it. Do not in any case go into debt to invest thinking you will be able to repay the loan and make a profit. It is the best way to ruin yourself and your family.

Lesson number 6
Each time you read that someone became a millionaire with 8000 dollars and feel the urge to invest everything in a shitcoin stop and think about the fact that there are thousands of people that lost everything doing that. You will most likely not be that lucky guy.

I hope you all become very rich, see you on the moon.

Then he woke up, had some coffee, did his morning routine while praying to Crypto gods, especially Satoshi, the Chosen. Went to his 9-5 job, during the job watched charts briefly. After end of the shift, he came home, had another coffee, did his home stuff, checked charts, smiled and grinned and then after sometime went to sleep peacefully. 

Very next day he woke up, seeing that Bitcoin dropped by 80%. Guy didn‚Äôt even flinched, or shat himself, he just lifted his shoulders like ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô, while feeling sad that his investments are gone and he doesn‚Äôt have any more of **FIAT** money to spare.

He has a ton of clips on youtube telling people to get out as quickly as possible. This is with NFTs too. Even if they are sitting on what we would think is an amazing opportunity.

I've been DCA into BTC, CRO, Algo and I've been loving it so far but ethereum seems just impossible. I could leave them on the CEX but I really fucking hate the idea of leaving coins on an exchange.

Is there a certain way you guys are doing this and if so, what is it? I really want to get into ethereum before 2.0 drops

Edit: I just realized ledger live has a swap function to swap between a couple coins. Bitcoin ethereum usdt usdc chain link uniswap xrp stellar and a couple more.

Wouldn't it be possible to transfer xrp onto my ledger live and then do a swap from xrp to ethereum?

From Wikipedia:  ‚ÄúMonero has the third largest developer community among cryptocurrencies, behind bitcoin and Ethereum. ‚Äú - is this correct? 

I am surprised with the above. I understand it has a loyal community that goes back many years, but as far as size, I would have thought others (Cardano, Solana) who have had bigger communities. 

It would be very cool if Monero did have a big community, as it would just show that whilst the recent speculators have been pushing up prices of the next-big-thing, there is a community in the background that remains committed to a project and it‚Äôs core ideology.

The European Commission's investigation revealed that some traders at the banks, involved in trading G10 currencies, had exchanged sensitive information and trading plans with each other. Using an online chatroom called **Sterling Lads,** they had also occasionally coordinated their trading strategies.  The sharing of information enabled them to make more informed decisions about when to buy or sell currencies and reduce risk compared to if they were operating alone. 

 It also allowed for collaboration on occasion such as the practice of standing down where one trader would hold off making a trade to avoid interfering with another trader. 

These colluding  happened between 2007 and 2013. But to the retail trader the message is clear, its not just enough that the big guys have nearly unlimited money they get at 0% interest rates, they will try any thing to make fools out of the small guy.

If this is happened with the big banks, it certainly happens with the big crypto traders. The advantages of such a cartel is far too lucrative to pass up.

It doesn't mean sell everything, it simply means start being more cautious, and have a decent cash:invested ratio.

Here's waht I have to say:

Hi everyone.

I wanted to make this post due to the obscene amount of ""buy the dip,"" ""what do i buy,"" and ""here's a list of what to buy "" posts; the greed in the air is absurd. The comments on every post, green or red day, have the current form: ""hmmmmm what are we buying? what's a good long-term buy?"" Few comments I see realize what's ahead. Pullbacks in the market are directly attributed to news as being a CAUSE not a CATALYST.

So, I would like to comment on the overall state of the market, where it's heading, and perhaps on the amount of different perspectives about the market sharply decreasing. It may be a lengthy post, but I heavily recommend you consider this point of view. Here, I present you with many charts supporting the fact that a major crash (not a pullback) is coming, and that ""buying the dips"" too early will erase the profits you obtained these past couple years.

I want to start off by showing you the [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/gB23ZTa) since the covid crash, it's a 30-day running volatility index. It's breaking out of the pattern that has formed since pandemic has begun. Now take a look at the zoomed out [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/uIwnFos), it'll give you an idea of what you would see on this chart in case the market gets into dangerous territory.

Moving onto the stock market, I'd like to show you some short and long-term patterns developing on indices, individual stocks, and the market as a whole.

First, here's the [SPY trend](https://imgur.com/xDRCcQv) that has developed since the pandemic begun. This pattern has not broken yet, but the momentum looks like it's moving into the dangerous sell area (below 0). I only show you this unbroken pattern so that you can carefully watch the development of the market. Now [zoom out](https://imgur.com/r3cu35o) to see the entirety of SPY's price action. The highlights and ratios are Fibonacci retracement ratios, they're simply mathematical ratios (developed from the Fibonacci sequence) that appear with a strangely-high frequency in nature, price movements of assets, and other areas of life. Anyway, I want to point out that the major major support that SPY has is at the price level of the 2000 and 2008 highs (somewhere around the $160ish area, a 65% pullback. That mark is the best case end-scenario for a market ""pullback""/""crash"" that we are looking at here, in my opinion. A smaller drop off sets the charts up for a larger drop later on, and a more violent drop (simply a retest of the 1994-2008 lows of SPY, i.e. $80ish) would still fit a ""very long term bullish american economy"" type of scenario (and is a very real possibility if fear overtakes folks enough).

Let's switch our attention to QQQ, the tech trust. Here's the entire price history of [QQQ](https://imgur.com/ylxodYD), in one chart. The case 1 support I have drawn up in the chart is very very likely not going to be the final bottom of the crash, but could very well be the relief area once things do start crashing. As you can see though, QQQ is in a parabolic state right now -- here the gains you miss out on by exiting early are the greatest, but the so is the risk of you staying in each one of those trades. As uncertainty grows, the investing and the gambling games start seeming more and more the same. Here's the [chart of TQQQ](https://imgur.com/VJGVdro). For those who do not know, it aims to reflect the daily returns on QQQ threefold. I saw many posts and comments saying they buy TQQQ on dips, and that TQQQ is up 20000% in a decade, so why wouldn't someone just buy TQQQ and wait. Please look up leveraged ETFs and try to understand that losses are amplified SIGNIFICANTLY in any of those types of ETFs, and they WILL get brought down painfully low during the incoming crash/pullback/whatever you want to call it.

It's very important to understand that price action is like the motion of a pendulum, it oscillates around a ""fair value/price"" (which also moves in a longer-term cycle); it's important to remember that the pendulum always eventually swings back to that ""fair"" value that noone technically knows for sure. What's also important is that swings do not ever stop at the actual fair value, they swing past with momentum, and the more violent the swing one way (regardless of whether it's up or down), the more violent the swing back will be.

Anyway, we can also go ahead and look at individual stocks. Let's take one of the strongest of them all, [GOOGL](https://imgur.com/uGlmzWr). Even this stock has had parabolic price action since becoming public. As you can see, even this strong stock has some room to drop off (perhaps the chart does imply this is one of those tickers that would do slightly better than the market in cases of a crash). The momentum on this has STARTED to slow down, but has not gone to the sale side of price action just yet, implying that we are starting to find the top, and slow down in the price discovery.

There's a point I also wanted to make about banking and financial institution stock tickers, as I hear the general way of reasoning here be something along the lines of ""interest rates will be going up, that directly benefits these institutions/companies."" While that line may be true, it's not the factor that most importantly decides which way the stock ticker will move. In the case of a crash/pullback, everything gets entangled. Specifically, we can look at [Bank of America](https://imgur.com/VWpn7Sq) as a good example here. This is one of the ""strong stock"" charts with the most concerning volume development, in my opinion. The absurd divergence has lasted well over a decade, and while BAC hasn't found it's very clear top/peak, we can see that that peak in price is nearby (if it hasn't already happened ofcourse, but I doubt it for this chart). I also am very weary of these types of banking stocks being around the peak prices of 1999-2008 era, combined with the volume divergence I was talking about, as well as the growing greed of everyday investors.

Alright, now I'd like to take a moment and direct your attention to the [DXY chart](https://imgur.com/oQs4R6W); this is the dollar currency index, it's basically the value of the US dollar, measured against a basket of other world currencies. The break above 93.5 on this chart is where we first saw the market pull back slightly more than was expected by the average trader. Long term, I see [two cases](https://imgur.com/QgglDU1) related to what happens to the US dollar. I won't comment on what would cause either of the cases; however, from the viewpoint of technical analysis, a major move is expected on this DXY chart in the coming years/decade. The FED has been printing money for almost a full year now, here's a [chart](https://imgur.com/ihobATQ) quantifying that printed amount. To add, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/D7wT86L) of annual inflation reports each month, showing obviously-dangerous levels of inflation. I don't have much comment to make here, but do be aware of this information please.

As my final couple points, I want to emphasize that I see everyone's points and strategies getting more and more similar; it's incredibly dangerous to blindly buy the dip or follow the general public, consider revising the possible perspectives on this issue. As you see people's emotions swinging more and more wildly side to side, you should be getting more and more cautious about the state of the current markets.

PLEASE CONSIDER READING THIS: there's a book called ""a random walk down wall street."" In the first chapter, it outlines the major bubbles in the past couple centuries. It's worth a read. Highly recommend.

Edit: Please please please stop buying the current dip. And please remember to zoom out, and not follow the heard, but rather study it. I'd also like to add that if you REALLY zoom out, zoom out 300-400 years ago, this is the chart you will see.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/blUB5we) is a great chart that Robert Prechter put together (the guy behind Elliott Wave Theory). There is a video out there where he talks about what a Fibonacci pattern he notices in the market. Look it up if you are interested, I am not allowed to give you the link here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: This is the time to be CAUTIOUS in the market, regardless of which market you are talking about. If you have unrealized profits on the table, consider securing a portion (perhaps a majority) of those profits. If you are facing a negative return on any position, do not close your phone or uninstall your app to simply wait for a year; you MUST reevaluate your positions, and adjust accordingly. Do not panic, but remember to stay weary of the ""heard"" mentality about markets -- the market always finds a way to humble its investors.",CryptoCurrency

I kept it up and continued to buy over these months and expanded from just BTC to several coins. 

I felt completely different seeing this massive drop. No fear or anxiety. I'm not worried I'm going to lose all my money and in fact, send some fiat over from my ""savings"" account in order to buy more at this discount.

I don't like seeing blood in the market. People are losing good ammount of money. Imagine having $100k and losing 25%, that is  $25k. That is good ammount of money.

But if you didn't sell before the dip I would hold it, at least that is what I am doing now. I won't sell at loss.

And yes, there is blood in the market, but people are making their money by investing when the price is low not otherwise.

If you have some fiat and believe in the projects that you picked, then buy some. Just DCA bit by bit.

I know I did.

I don't like the dip, but it is a good opportunity to buy more.

Especially since we had to pool together the money for incorporating the business and everything. I am happy to report that all of us are still together and no one ran with the moolah.

Here are some of the highlights so far:

* The trading algorithm supports a number of signals, from volatility to technical analysis, making it easy to implement complex trading systems that are fully automated.
* We decided to work with AWS secret manager in order to keep your API keys securely stored.
* We've laid out the foundation of Social Trading! In the future you will be able to simply clone another user's bot.
* The tool's name is Aesir - because we're all Norse mythology geeks.

SEC rejecting spot ETF for bitcoin: Many traders/ investors pumped their money into the crypto world with the hope that there would be a spot ETF for bitcoin which would increase the demand of Bitcoin (crypto) and hence the prices would surge, however SEC rejected the idea.  

2. Evergrande crisis: A China giant, unable to fulfill their debt obligations. This should have some repercussions on stable-coins tied to USD and thus will have an indirect impact on Crypto as a whole.  

3. Major economies with their negative or regulatory stance on cryptocurrency: India trying to restrict the trade of cryptocurrencies to a certain native exchanges. China considering punitive electricity charge for crypto mines, and so on. Extra bullish stance on bitcoin by leaders like the president of El Salvador is not helping either- instead it is creating a negative image of our community as a whole.  

4. Liquidation of leveraged traders: Cryptocurrencies worth several billion dollars were liquidated forcing a negative loop of selling cycle. Even bitcoin worth several billions were liquidated. Every passing hour more and more traders are getting liquidated.

The wrong reasons:
Crypto is meant to fix something, whether its currency, SOV, defi, NFT or anything else.  The price of your crypto doesn‚Äôt really affect its use case.  The only reason you‚Äôd care is if you were in crypto for the money which is referenced below.

Over invested:

When scrolling through this sub right now I see many people freaking out and spreading FUD. I have been in crypto since 2016, so I have a bit of experience. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don't mean that everything is okay, but hear me out.

The market always moves in Cycles. There are always ups and downs. In the last Bull run (2017/2018) there were 5 major dips, all with BTC dropping by \~40%. It had always  recovered and so this it will this time. Follow these steps:

1. **Ask yourself: is the Cryptospace and the technology behind it future-proof?** Did the fundamentals that started making you believe in this changed? Surely not. Crypto is just at the beginning and even if we are not super early, we are still early enough before mass adoption comes, so we are actually good! No matter where you bought in, how big your unrealised loss is at the moment, the chances of you buying the exact ATH it will ever reach is 0. The market will recover, chase new ATH, dip again, recover and so on. Sure, this dip is scary as hell, but if you can afford to hold - DO IT! I don‚Äôt know when, if in 2 days, 2 weeks, months or even years, but you will see profit and get at least what you invested back.
2. Also, as everyone says (and almost nobody listens to), always remember to only invest what you can afford to lose! If your portfolio ist currently down and you need that money, here‚Äôs what to do: **DONT TRY CHASING LOSSES**
   1. ‚Äã **Ask yourself: Do I need the money in the next few weeks?** Sell 20% now and watch the markets. If they recover, wait, if they don‚Äôt, sell another 20% and so on. That way you‚Äôll still keep something in case the market goes back up and cashed out a bit in case everything goes down the drain even further. Only do so if you really need that money in the next week or so, otherwise see 1. and please don‚Äôt repeat that mistake in the future.
   2. ‚Äã Last but not least: **LEARN from the dip!** I know it‚Äôs quite exciting to double, triple or whatever multiply your portfolio but don‚Äôt fall for greed! Keep in mind that stocks in general rise about \~7% per year, gains that you make here on a good day. Crypto is a risky investment, that‚Äôs why the possible returns are so much higher. Next time you have made some profit, think about selling and realising gains. Everybody has seen the posts of 15 year olds with 7 digit portfolios, but how many of them cashed out and really bought the lambo? Most of them kept gambling and lost a significant amount if not all afterwards. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you to HODL if you feel uncomfortable and made some juicy gains - leave! It‚Äôs your life, your money and only your decision!

**TL;DR** Don‚Äôt panic, prices will rise someday in the future, you only lose if you sell at loss. If you need that money urgently, sell in small portions. Take time to overthink your strategy and maybe next time don‚Äôt let FOMO take over. Also remember that is better to go home with some nice 30% realised gains, rather than 400% unrealised gains.

t3_r89eou,One approach on how to find those tokens making X100 before it's too late?,"*Disclaimer: none of this is my own work nor am I affiliated with the people behind the article, but it is in my experience that posts get noticed more often when posted on here vs when merely linking the article.* [*This is the source for this information*](https://cazoo.it/en/token/come-trovare-quei-token-che-fanno-x100-prima-che-sia-troppo-tardi/amp/)*.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

When it comes to cryptocurrency there is probably nothing more important than ""*Do your own research*"".

Do Your Own Research, say English speakers. DYOR.

There is a lot of information out there and it can be difficult to understand what is real and has potential, what is real and doesn't have much potential, or what is there just waiting to rip you off. However, if you really want to commit, you need to learn how to do your research - let's see how you figure out if it's a crypto to stay away from or perhaps worth holding.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not a financial advisor. I don't advise you how to invest your money. I don't help anyone use this majestic network of blockchains and dapps. Investing your money and making it bear fruit is everyone's dream, and if it becomes a path that you want to take, the only advice I give is to do it with extreme caution.

&amp;#x200B;

 

## 1st Phase: Market activity

The first step in starting a research on the best cryptocurrency X100 will do in two weeks is to ask yourself: **this coin is economically active**? I've seen so many promising cryptocurrency projects, only to then verify how active a currency is within the market and‚Ä¶ it's been dead for months or even years.

### What to do?

Go to a site like coinmarketcap.com or coingeko.com to see if it is a live currency, if there is any activity, transactions made with it, be sure to check the trading volume and how the price is moving.

Not only should that token be listed within an Exchange with a good reputation, but the trading volume in that market should also be quite high, I would say significant: if it wasn't, you might find yourself paying a '*premium option* since the *order book* they did not circulate liquidity enough.

If the token you're looking at is an ERC20 protocol token, which is traded almost exclusively on DEX like Uniswap, be sure to proceed with caution, as DEXs don't have unsurpassed pricing criteria or requirements. All of this isn't THE reason to leave a project out, but it's something to keep in mind as you move forward.

Price is key, but that's not all. Let's assume that the cryptocurrency you have chosen has a legitimate economic boost. It's time to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it is and how it works.

DYOR.

## 2nd Phase: The initial research

Youtube is definitely a good place to start. But there is a lot of chaos. That's why my advice is to switch by **Messaria**, **Binance Research**, and from an ICO monitoring site such as **Icodrops**. Pretend Going Back To School: When using these resources be sure to take notes and jot down any questions you may have. Now you won't need them, you won't find the answers. But right now you are not trying to get those answers but you are starting a journey.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7z4mwhuo8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72d5ee9899670d6a45373ce1282ebff0c9d53b17

 

**Messari is a powerful tool** that you can use to analyze cryptocurrencies. The section that I think you should be interested in is that of the crypto profile you are interested in. Messari guys do a comprehensive analysis that includes cryptocurrency history, tokenomics, and token allocations. They come to an incredibly detailed level and even a timeline of past development and fundraising as well as a roadmap for the future of the project.

Write down the names of all the key people involved in the project, ie the founder and the CEO (assuming they are not the same person) .. you will need them later.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jngluqaq8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b8f621419a988b00b0cfa340fe94fe52a10d9a

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Research done by Binance** instead they take a more technical approach to analyzing any token. It is extremely helpful to have research with this cut, to understand the main components of crypto and how it works.

The great thing about the research generated by Messari and Binance is that because they are the Hollywood stars in the crypto space, a high degree of professionalism is expected of them. They are not just fat cows: the information on Messari and Binance is not up to date. You can't really blame them: they're doing so much more‚Ä¶ but that's okay too. It is already a first slap that is telling you: do not take anything written by a third party as pure gold, as an excuse to put an end to all your research, even if that source is very well known.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvljidar8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ce36074092d9a9b2ecad0b815c97f9b1d18bfe

 

**ICO tracking sites, like Icodrops, are a kind of time machine**: for certain crypto they have made available old images and documentation that is no longer available on the website. So it's easy to spot if a cryptocurrency project has changed the direction it was going, or if it's simply trying to bury the past. Unfortunately the total amount of money raised that is reported by Icodrops and similar sites is not always accurate, and tends to include all funds raised both in private funding rounds and through multiple ICOs. Remember to always look for pictures or charts where you can clearly see the breakdown of the token, how the money was collected and where the tokens were assigned.

Messari does a good job of tracking token funding and allocations - you can cross this information with Icodrops to get clear on how a given crypto project has increased its capital. What you are looking for here is a token allocation that doesn't make you want to run away .. specifically you want to make sure that most of the tokens that have been issued or will be issued are in the hands of the community and not in the pockets of the people who founded the project! Holders of most tokens could potentially sell when the price starts to rise, which would prevent the coin from growing in value organically.

As before, it is not that if this condition is lost, the whole project is a project to be discarded. But you have to be very careful when you see an image like this, checking the tokenomics of a crypto on Binance Research or Messari:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tgxrux7s8e381.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6ea8b2c36e43aa5177faf36e164bd75f6b3e8f

&amp;#x200B;

 

Now that you've checked everything out, it's time to head back to Youtube. Since you trust that crypto, now that you have a good understanding of it, let's hear what those who created it have to say. Pick up the names you remembered to write, the names of the key people involved in the project. Your next task will be to find the most recent interviews they've done. Arrange them in chronological order and watch as many as you can!

DYOR.

## 3rd Phase: Research the Sources

Seeing is believing: Watching interviews with key members of the crypto project you follow offers a treasure trove of information you won't find anywhere else. Furthermore, these interviews often help me a lot to understand the technical elements of a project that I might have a hard time understanding simply by reading the documentation, almost often found on the crypto site. While you're at it, check LinkedIn profiles to see if they have good credentials. If they worked in Google or Microsoft is it good? Yes, if the hiring did not last a few months. If they were fired because they were mining crypto, then *gimme five*! Search the Youtube channel of the crypto currency you are interested in! If you are good at researching, you will find short videos explaining the main components of the project.

This adds two more steps to the search: *fact check*, always, everything you have learned so far, and try to understand what is in store in the future of this cryptocurrency.

DYOR.

## Step 4: Double check: double check

Have you already been to a crypto website to be overwhelmed by tons of information? You only want to read the home page and the information section. Most of the information about a particular crypto site tends to be a bunch of trivia. Obviously, banking and non-banking transactions or some other noble cause they claim to support. Most of the content in general is useless and won't be helpful in figuring out if the project deserves your attention. Most importantly, you risk wasting a lot of time browsing their site if you don't know what you are looking for. But since you remembered to write down the names of the key components of this project and you wrote down all the questions you wanted an answer to ... well then it's time to verify that everything you learned still applies and solves your questions that they have arisen since you began your research.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lh2a5hrt8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d964ca29622c912ecd8c497d1315482a4f8968

 

You can find many of the answers by digging into the section dedicated to Documentation .. maybe you are lucky and there is also a search bar and you can enter terms such as **tokenomics**, **inflation**, **ICO**, **consent mechanisms**, **mining**, **staking** and any other topic where you want to get more clarification. Is there no search? Search by hand.

Don't be scared if you don't understand anything right away - crypto documentation is usually developer-oriented. Many of the pages will have lines of code. Forget the code, read what is written just before and after. It is usually the most potable written code.

Another document to look for on a crypto site is the **white paper**: search for a section related to *tokenomics*. Look for a **blockchain explorer** of that crypto. Is it an ERC20 Token? Then go to Etherscan. Is it BEP20? Go to the Bscscan.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3b56i21v8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e1075169986e2ac80be1aac670270a6e07e52a

 

Here you can quickly check who are the largest holders of a particular token, you can even see it in a pie chart!

We have already said it: be careful if there are wallets that hold 90% of the tokens in circulation. But that's not always the case: it often happens that the wallet you see at the top of the list, the one that holds the majority of the token, is a Smart Contract, which is used for things like **staking**.

If your crypto is not an ERC20 token, hopefully their blockchain explorer will also allow you to see an exhaustive list of who holds the token. Don't they? RED FLAG.

Now that you have done a great research on the crypto you want to invest in, there is only one thing missing: to look for important updates of the project, whether they are coming, planned, or have already taken place.

DYOR.

## 5th Phase: News and the RoadMap

For the last part of your crypto search you will need three things: one **Roadmap**, for an **blog** and recent news .. I recommend, in this order: usually the news is a summary of what they write in the blog.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjqumn9w8e381.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad660b1e1bd2e0a3fcfc783c9206532287177ddf

&amp;#x200B;

 

Take advantage of the news you read in even small publications: they can come in handy if the blog post they refer to is too long or complicated to digest.

Let's talk now about RoadMap.

In my experience, cryptocurrency RoadMaps tend to be vague and don't provide the information we're actually looking for. Watching interviews with founders and CEOs will provide far more insight into the future of their project than its RoadMap. In a good crypto, you will find a nice roadmap that contains realistic goals, which can be achieved before the project runs out of funds or is destroyed by the competition. If you don't find any RoadMaps and if the interviews you've watched don't give you the feeling that the project will last a very long time‚Ä¶ maybe you're looking at the wrong investment.

The future is not all that matters: find out if they have achieved what they have promised to do to date .. and here comes the blog.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dhqnug4x8e381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4445225ef252d6b6f6f74c2673b2eeb86f44a16c)

If you're having a hard time finding a blog on a crypto's website, chances are you'll find it on their **Medium**. Other times you will have to go and browse theirs **GitHub** to see their progress .. from that you can really ask yourself if the project is progressing in the desired direction.

Browsing through the blog headlines of a crypto project is just more than enough to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhether it was true to its word and the direction it is headed. It's good to go then actually read the whole article if that update talks about significant updates like those related to changes in tokenomics or any announcement that talks about big *partnership*.

As a last resort, open a new tab and open some cryptocurrency news sites such as Cointelegraph, Coindesk or Decrypt and try to find some headlines dedicated to the project you are looking for. Can't find anything? That's not necessarily a bad sign as compared to traditional media, the crypto world media does things their own way, and they don't always like to tell big headlines about important things that happen.

At this point you should have all the information you need to make a good judgment that a cryptocurrency has real value and is tied by a legitimate project. If you don't have a good judgment of it, you are probably dealing with a project to watch out for, or even stay away from. It's bad to think about it, but it could also mean you'll have to go back, *back to the drawing board*, and check the resources you used in your research.

Researching crypto is a lot of work. But ask yourself: is a few hours of research worth it for a 100x return on your investment? ‚Ä¶ ..‚Ä¶ ..‚Ä¶ ..

DYOR.

## Conclusions

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Primo*: I go to coinmarketcap or coingecko to see if the token is actively trading, preferably on reliable exchanges. Is the coin dead or dying? I don't waste time.

*Second*: I go to Youtube and see what other people have said about the project, and take a few notes if it's worth it.

*Third*: check Messari and Binance research, to get a clearer idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat and what the project is and how it works. I keep taking notes, and I also start jotting down a few questions and the names of the founders.

*Room*: check Icodrops to see how much funds the project managed to raise and how the tokens were awarded. I use the sources that show together with Messari to double check that the details listed are correct.

*Fifth*: I go back to Youtube and watch all the interviews I can, among the most recent, made with the CEO or the founder of the project. Very often what they say answers many of the questions I wrote in the second passage: they also tend to clarify many components that I thought were confusing about the technology used. I am also looking for a Youtube channel of the crypto, and if it is present it often offers insights and additional explanations. Assuming that everything I discovered hasn't dampened my enthusiasm,

*Sixth*: dig into the project documentation. I look for any additional details to the technology used by that crypto, consensus mechanisms, tokenomics, staking rewards, mining requirements, and any other key components that I have learned so far.

*Seventh*: I sift through their RoadMap and blog to see if they have made the progress they promised and if they can realistically build and deliver whatever they need to move their project forward.

*Eighth*: check if their business has made headlines in the crypto space with big and exciting headlines in major crypto publishers. If there are no big headlines, watch out! Maybe we are in a critical moment of the project, and we got there before the others.

This strategy of mine for doing effective cryptocurrency research is certainly not bulletproof. But for me it is a perfect blend of observation, reading and repetition.

It is easy to forget that the world of cryptocurrencies is a very new field, much is still in its infancy. So, if you learn how to get good at doing your crypto research right now you will become one of the few people who really knows what's going on when FOMO hits a bullish market ... as it happened recently, on April 22, 2021, after the statements of the President Biden.

Been holding and hoarding crypto for awhile now, over a year, I'm comfortably still in profit, but I panicked on my first dip, if this is yours, and you think it'll dip further, then do what you think is best for you, sell some, buy more, whatever you want.

Yes, if you have a big ammount of money this is not something that you enjoy watching. If you invested more then you can lose it is your fault. This is a high volatile market and we said it many times.

I didn‚Äôt sell before the crash, I didn‚Äôt put buying orders, silly me.

And what should I do now? Panick? Cry?  

Did you know that if you were buying last year at this time that with most of the coins in the top 100 you would still be in profit? Who says next year won't be like that?

t3_r89yvg,Crypto twitter is mostly BS,"I was told that twitter is THE place for crypto. You find new NFT projects, you catch the trend and you just have a feeling whats going on in the crypto space. But thats just not true. Ive realized that crypto twitter is mostly influencers twittering shitty jokes, short comments about the market that dont bring any value, crazy predictions without any base, a lot of drama and useless promotions/giveaways. Everyone has a lot to say, but the only goal is to be loud, have attention and thats it. At least thats what i feel like.

t3_r8jvtw,What to keep in mind after price retracements such as this one. Remain sensible.,"\-If you sell at times like this you will have a very hard time making money consistently or being successful with investing in crypto or in general, because **this is normal** considering the amount of growth we have had this year.

\-**Stop watching the money in your account go down**. Look at the price trajectory relative to the amount of time the asset has traded.

\-BTC at **40k as of September 3rd**...its now 3 months later **December 4th where its at 47.8k after** a big retracement...what are you concerned about exactly? You should be happy we are up 7-8k in just 3 months. My theory is just that the majority of people here are pretty young and lack the emotional maturity and the experience in the markets or investing in general to view things this way.

\-If you don't always buy the top, you have nothing to complain about, **and if you do always buy the top, you'll still make money in the long term** if you buy top 10 coins because they will track the overall crypto market which will grow. Seriously, **look at every peak on an ETH or BTC chart...if you bought nothing more than the high peaks, you'd average out to a lower price than we currently are, and you'd be well in the money.**

\-So therefore buy dips and hold it. In all likelihood this is the easiest way to make money if you are buying projects which will stay in or close to the top 10.",CryptoCurrency

I know there's some inherent risk in going for airdrops, as it can be a method for malicious actors to access your wallet (so keep that in mind if there's some shady answers below lol), but I'm really curious what yall do to increase the likelihood of getting some sweet airdrops down the line, esp with the AVAX and ADA ecosystems starting to gain momentum.

t3_r8eh5j,If we keep trending down and you have the urge to tell friends and family to buy the dip over the next few weeks; don‚Äôt. They will think you‚Äôve lost your mind and need an intervention. Here‚Äôs why:,"When the market is pumping and you won‚Äôt shut up about your gains, you‚Äôre ‚Äúan asshole‚Äù but people get it. People can fundamentally understand the psychology about bragging when you did something that worked out. Especially if it made you money. 

The issue is that when an actual crash happens, you know the opportunity that awaits but if you try and share this with people, you will go from  looking like an asshole to looking insane. 

You will look like you‚Äôve absolutely lost your mind because they will have just seen the latest attention grabbing headline in the news: ‚ÄúBTC crashes 10% overnight‚Äù. With this, they have just had all their biases confirmed; crypto is a scam and the bubble has finally burst. They feel validated and proud that they didn‚Äôt fall for this pyramid scheme. 

Then there‚Äôs you. 

To them, you look like an insane babbling idiot. ‚Äú10% is nothing. I don‚Äôt even check my portfolio until I see deep double digit moves. This is actually a good time to load up your bags and buy more at a discount‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt work. If you‚Äôre right and they make money, it‚Äôs very unlikely they will appreciate it. If you‚Äôre wrong, you‚Äôre an asshole and **you** lost all their money.

t3_r8ta3p,YSK funding rates are important to understanding the market,"Funding rates can be a good indicator of whether the market is overleveraged and whether there is an opportunity to short the market in order to liquidate those traders.

Anything over 0.02%, is overleveraged. If it gets above 0.03%, watch for whales to move in to drop the prices resulting in overleveraged traders liquidating. Then watch the whales re-enter to buy coins at a discount.

Check out this [link.](https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate) (Coinglass) to follow funding rates.

Funding rate for BTC was up to .033% yesterday and went down to -.011% overnight to around .003% at the time of this post. Keep in mind funding rate is not a predictor of price change. Its simply another metro worth looking at to better understand the market.",CryptoCurrency

This loss, if you are in an exchange, will be tax deductible (if not in an exchange is the same, but harder to demonstrate). 
Since the IRS does not consider crypto assets as securities/stocks, these are not subject too the Wash-Sale Rule, so basically you can sell at loss and buy 1 minute later, only loosing the transaction fee, but wining the tax deduction.

t3_r8l0oq,Who's to blame? Who benefits the most?,"For everyone who loves the color Red, this must be a great way to wake up. 

I guess we are all trying to figure out who is to blame for this crash? Why did it happen just when Europe was sound asleep, right when the weekend started, and when most Americans were about to go to bed...? 

It almost seems too well coordinated to be just a coincidence. I understand the house of cards idea, but something must have planned this... 

In order to find out who did it, I guess we have to start looking at who benefits the most? 


- A group of Whales? I can imagine that Whales live in the same crypto tax havens or are at least in touch with one another. Why compete with one another if you can coordinate to make more profit? --but is this enough of get a crash like this?


- Banks? Crypto is a major threat to the banking world. I think it is silly to believe they haven't already invested heavily into crypto themselves, which makes it easier for them to manipulate the market to A) make a lot of profit, B) discourage people into buying Crypto with crashes like this, C) to send a strong message to the influential people ( politicians, celebrities, but also news papers), and D) to encourage more restrictions and regulations on Crypto. 


- Stock Market? See arguments for Banks, I guess... if they are not one and the same. 


- Governments? I haven't heard of any new restriction/regulation in the past 6 hours, so this one seems unkikely. 


- Omicron - if it would cause it dip, then we already had it. 


- Political tension? Russia near the Ukranian border? I don't think we'll see any effect until they decide to invade early 2022.

t3_r8he3j,"Whenever the Crypto Market dips, people try to connect it with the latest news. But its always manipulators doing their thing!","I have seen this one too many times. I get it. People put their life savings in crypto, they are always watching the news, Youtube videos and reading articles about it.

When the market dips, fear comes around. Viewers retention rises on youtube, articles get read alot and people put on the news more often.

Though these YouTubers, reporters dont know any better than you do.

They always connect the crash with recent bad news. 

Now they are connecting this crash to Stock market crash. 
2 days ago it was the new COVID variant.

6 days ago it was Indian government.

A month ago it was Evergrande.

In may it was Elon Musk. 


We have to realise, crypto sure is volatile, but is not as unstable as we think it is. It always requires manipulators to make crypto so volatile. 

When the big guns want to get in on Crypto, they use the manipulators to bring the price down.
Paid news articles follow the course. 

They get in at low prices.

Market rises, keeps heading up. When their stomach is full, they pay news articles to write about how crypto will keep heading high. How certain coins will 100x, 1000x from here onwards. New investors fall prey to that, and that is when these greedy rich people sell.

My advice to myself is, do not believe the news or a Youtuber. Follow your instict. Get in with what you can lose, and get out when its enough.

Too many options and not enough fiat.

t3_r7tm7s,Crypto.com Marketing Spend,"I work in advertising sales at one of the largest media &amp;amp; entertainment companies on the planet. We closed a 1-year deal this week with CRO. Without sharing the exact number, I will say that their marketing spend is the single largest 1-year deal I‚Äôve ever worked on in my 8-year career working with 400+ domestic &amp;amp; international advertisers. Their campaign kicks off next week &amp;amp; runs thru 2022 on National TV, digital, etc. If they‚Äôre spending this much on our networks, that means they‚Äôre likely spending just as much with the other major media networks/companies/platforms. Factor that in with their [former] Staples Center arena naming deal and their partnerships with UFC, Formula One, etc.. and you‚Äôve got one of the largest marketing spends in recent history. I would not be surprised if they break some type of record for 1-year media spends. If Crypto.com isn‚Äôt already household name, I am absolutely certain that the size of their 2022 marketing campaign will make them one early next year. As the crypto space continues to trend upward in terms of mainstream adaption, my only hope is that casual first-time crypto investors will turn to Crypto.com if they want to dip their toes in the crypto space. They‚Äôre literally gonna see their ads everywhere. It‚Äôll be natural.

I do not know about technical analysis, but I know that it does not give a shit about cryptocurrencies.

However, looking at the charts I think that what was supposed to be has already happened and some cryptos are slowly bouncing back and in a while everything will start to grow again.

Let's see if you are one of those people who are afraid or you are also optimistic?

The most important thing is the attitude, after all, each of us believes in the future of cryptocurrencies and claims that DCA, that he holds firm, that after all, fuck FIAT, inflation, governments. So why all the panic? What are you afraid of man, hold firm to your beliefs.

Fuck what's happening now, everything is passing and I'm almost sure that in some time everyone will be on the plus side. So don't panic, don't look at the charts, go spend time with your family etc. The worst thing is to worry about it and in panic sell at the bottom and then regret.

t3_r8sjxu,Never have more in Crypto then you can afford to lose.,"I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for years. Every price increase is followed with FOMO and people wondering if they are ‚Äútoo late‚Äù. Every crash and people are freaking out. 

We don‚Äôt talk enough about actual sound investment strategies. Not just buy high and sell low. But you should never have more in crypto then you can afford to lose. 

Crypto is not a retirement plan. It is not a savings account. This is high risk speculation. Crypto is somewhere between a drunk night at a casino and a lottery ticket. Yes, you can make money. Yes, you can lose money in more stable investments. But in terms of absolute risk you should not be investing money into crypto if you need that money for real life expenses. 

Every investment, crypto or not, should have an exit plan. Whenever you make a purchase you need to decide how long your holding that asset, and when your exiting. That exit includes a loss and a gain. If your portfolio is worth more then you can stomach to lose, cash out. There is nothing wrong with walking away with realized gains. You can not hem and haw about ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù You need to make that exit strategy at purchase, not crash. 

Also, remember that until you cash out you haven‚Äôt lost or gained anything. Just because your portfolio is worth seven figures one day and four the next doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve lost anything. It just means the value of what you hold is less. If you think it‚Äôs going to go back up and can afford to keep the money put stop looking at your account and find a new hobby for a while.",CryptoCurrency

I normally have my recurring weekly buys do the work for me, but I wouldve lost out on 10% lower buys than I would if I waited until now. Buy timing the market I've managed to lower my AVG buy from a few of my coins. 

If I'd of left it to the recurring buy, this wouldn't of happened. I know people here like to say time in the market is better than timing, but when you're able to lower your AVG cost it's always a good idea to do so. Especially when the coin is massively under its ATH (unless it's ICP) 

Treat your DCA like you treat your HODL and forget about it, sure. But always have extra funds to buy more coins when the market drops this low. 

""What if it drops more tomorrow"" obviously buy more. Don't go broke on buying huge amounts, but definitely continue to buy more as it goes down, the more you buy and the lower it goes the cheaper your AVG cost per coin will be.

t3_r8o500,Now is the time to buy or harvest some losses,"With the market crashing this morning, now is a good time to buy in at a lower price (compared to previous prices) or reduce your taxes via tax-loss harvesting.

And tax-loss harvesting could be a useful strategy right now if you've managed to make significant gains through this bull run.

Now, I'm no expert on tax-loss harvesting but I will share a short excerpt of [this guide](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-tax-loss-harvesting/) as a kinda TLDR:

# What is it?

&gt; Tax-loss harvesting is an investment strategy that helps reduce your net capital gains and, in turn, reduces your tax bill for the financial year.

# How does it work?

&gt; If you make a capital gain *(profit on your crypto when you sell)*, you‚Äôll pay Capital Gains Tax on the profit from your disposal. If you make a capital loss, you don‚Äôt pay tax on it.

&gt; When you file your taxes as part of your annual tax return - you‚Äôll report both your net capital gain and net capital loss. You subtract your net capital loss from your net capital gain and the amount left is the amount you‚Äôll pay Capital Gains Tax on.

&gt; Crypto tax loss harvesting is when an investor sells crypto at a loss to create a capital loss to offset it against their capital gains and reduce their overall tax bill.

# In a nutshell (true TLDR):

Sell some of your cryptos now to create a capital loss to offset the gains you may have made throughout the year and you, therefore, pay fewer taxes.

# Note:

This is the basics of it and a lot of the rules around it will vary from country to country. 

So, if you're looking to use this strategy I recommend you check [the guide](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-tax-loss-harvesting/) I linked above as they cover some nuances in the rules of how to do this and go into much more detail than I did.

If you need to see where we left off with the latest update, check here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r63us8/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_midweek_6_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

If you're not familiar with the project, 6 weeks ago I started a 1 year experiment where I am investing in alt-coins using a slightly modified DCA approach. Bottom line is each of the 16 coins in the project (plus 3 coins I chose as controls) gets a $25 buy once every 4 weeks. Each coin was suggested by someone in the sub and in the end I will donate some money from the winning coin to a charity of their choosing.

After my midweek update, things started to pick up. By Thursday I was looking great, portfolio up ~7%, LUNA, MATIC, AVAX, CRO and EGLD were all jockeying for position and at various points throughout the week, all 5 of those had been the highest percentage gainer in the portfolio. Well, I don't know if any of you noticed, but Friday was not a great day for either the stock market or crypto. Before I went to bed on Friday night I took a quick glance and I was down around 20%.

When I woke up Saturday morning it appeared that the downward spiral at least was stopped. My portfolio had ""recovered"" somewhat to ""only"" be down ~15%. I took a few minutes to evaluate my thoughts on this. Yes there was some scary market news and some bad news for the crypto market in general, but did my overall thesis change? Well, for me, the answer is no. I still believe that crypto is the future. So I decided to take action.

I quickly moved to position new moneys onto the various exchanges I am using for the experiment (CoinBase, Binance.us, Crypto.com, BlockFi and KuCoin for anyone wondering) and made a 1 time buy of $25 for every one of the coins in the project. Less than an hour later, nearly every one of those purchases is net positive. Time will tell if that holds true or if we see a further dip.

I wanted to post this update prior to my full update later today because I see a lot of discussion on here about whether now is the right time to buy/sell/hold onto what you've got. I'm lucky in that I'm in a position where I have not invested more than I can afford to lose and I am able to look at my position and decide that this is the right course of action for me.

If you are in a similar position to me and you believe in the future in this space, now may be a good time to do like I did and make a one-time purchase at what appear to be discounted rates. If this dip made you realize that you really can't afford to lose the money you've got invested in the crypto space though, maybe this is an opportunity to rethink your holdings and move some into safer investments (responsibly of course, please don't panic sell). Everyone's risk profile and approach will be different, but ultimately it's a very personal decision we all have to make. Don't feel bad about making a well thought out decision that is right for your financial situation.

As for the project, I wanted to post this update because this was outside of the established framework I had for the project and while I did it in what I think is a very fair way (even purchases of all coins in the experiment) I wanted to provide an update to those who have been following along. I don't have time to compile all the data regarding individual pricing right now, but I will provide that either later today or tomorrow when I have more time. As always if you're curious about where the various holdings sit and which coins are on top, you can check out the portfolio on CoinGecko using this link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment

As of the time I'm making this post, the portfolio balance is $1,246.57 for a total loss so far of $78.28 (-5.91%). You can use this to guesstimate total value in each coin currently.

t3_r8oxet,Here's Where We Separate The Men From The Boys,"Okay so in the past year or two we've seen a flood of new investors into both the stock market and crypto. Many investors have only seen markets to up up and up some more. Yeah occasionally we'll see a 7% pullback which let's be honest is more ""cute"" than ""scary"" and people will talk about nows the time to buy the dip and if you're not ready for the downs you don't deserve the ups.

While we've not yet seen what I would call a crash, we're getting into the territory where a lot of people in this subs dicks are shrinking and their buttholes are puckering. Were not yet in the territory of posting suicide hotline numbers but if Bitcoin dips below 40k which is a real possibility, my bottom prediction is just under 38k, we're really going to see a separation of the men from the boys. 

I think this is also a lesson to take profits and keep some cash on the sidelines. When things are going up it seems like it's never going to stop and when things are falling it seems like they're never going to come back. This is the pullback people at least have been saying they've been waiting for, but the reality is most people will be too scared to take advantage of it.

Another thing that will be interesting to see is this. Historically we've seen the stock market can drag cyrpto down, but is the reverse true, can crypto drag the stock market down. Head over to a sub like r/stocks and you can see the panic over there. Only thing is their market is closed so they have to bite their finger nails until Monday mornning to see what's going to happen. Now that crypto has more mainstream involvement and institutional involvement can crypto prices and/or crashes be the canary in the coal mine of what's to come for stocks on Monday?

There's no rewards for being in crypto for a long time and there's no seniority bonuses. I saw a post of someone the other day who was upset because they'd been in crypto for years and  years recently got a friend into it who did well off some meme coins and while the friend was a butthole sanchez for rubbing it in their face, especially considering she was the one who got her friend into crypto, it shows there's no bonuses or rewards for having known about or bought into crypto early on, if you bought bitcoin at 40k rode it to 60k and then it crashes back to 40k you have nothing to show for your money if you didn't take some profits along the way. 

I guess what I'm saying is this, sack up boys, if this is too much for you take your money out of your Coinbase or Crypto.Com account and go start dollar cost averaging into VTI. If that's not you take this as an opportunity to re-evaluate your positions, setup a new DCA strategy and keep on trucking.",CryptoCurrency

BTC is down around %6

It's interesting to note a large amount of options contracts are expiring at the end of this month, and I'm somewhat curious if there's a large push to hold prices down in the short term to avoid some bad contracts and punish overleveraged positions.

Everyone was saying it was because of ""Omicron"" but that's highly doubtful considering that news broke more than a week ago.

I find it odd that the random daily pumps and dumps of $3k up and down caused no liquidations really either way, but this relatively mild percentage drop actually had a fairly large impact.

t3_r82ows,After the Badger Dao hack everyone should get in the practice of revoking smart contract access on their wallets once their initial use is complete.,"Badger Dao was hit almost 2 days ago.  From what I understand It was done by breaking into the creators cloudflare account and dropping malicious code onto their site header.  It then had the users agree to a malicious contract and drained their wallets.

While not all smart contracts are malicious, duh, there are risks that come with signing these contracts with the ability to TransferFrom your account.  Once agreeing to said contract there money can be pulled from that account without further approval. This means 2fa and ledger will not protect you if the contract is malicious.  These contracts have you agree to a set limit up to infinite.  When agreeing to them you are often able to edit them and see what it is asking for.  Some protocols will allow you to change the set amount on the contract, but not all.

Staking and wrapping contracts can be examples of these contracts with transfer from ability.  They are popular on OHM forks.

When it comes to rebasing in an OHM fork protocol like these you should not need to keep the smart contract access to your accounts active to continue receiving said rebases.  I have tested this with multiple account on Wonderland and am still receiving rebases on my wrapped memo.

It doesn't matter how much faith or trust or whatever you have in a protocol or it's owners.  There are still risks involved.  Check your approved contracts every time you log out of your wallet just to be sure.  There's no reason to leave a contract with such abilities just sitting open on your account after the initial use.  

Tip: connecting a wallet is different than signing a contract.  Said contract will require a transaction fee and be visible on the chain.  Connecting a wallet simply allows a site to see you address and give you information relevant to it.

Do yourself a favor and use a token allowance tracker to see what contracts are currently approved.  Revoke access to anything that has completed it's use.   Revoking access essentially approves a 0 spend limit.  This will cost you a transaction fee. When you need to move the money around again the protocol will ask you to sign the contract once more.

There are plenty of token allowance trackers.  Make sure to use one that works with the chains you have contracts on.  Snowtrace has one for Avalanche.  DeBank has one for quite a few chains.  Use one you trust.

If you would like more info on this here is a good medium article on the TransferFrom issue with these defi 2.0 sites.  

https://brogna.medium.com/token-allowance-dc553f7d38b3

If everyone in the BadgerDAO was in the practice of checking approved contracts after they were done working with their crypto the vast majority of users would have been safe.  They would have seen a third contract and been able to identify it as malicious.  This script was injected on Nov 10.  The scammers waited until critical mass before draining.  If the users had checked their contracts and removed them after using the site then said contracts would not have had approval to move any of their money when the actual drain hit.  It's just good practices.

Good luck out there everyone.  It's fucking scary these days.  It's the wild west.  Be safe.

t3_r8qitd,A solution to the 5$ wrench attack?,"  

Many people wonder about the best way to secure their cryptos. Whether it is to protect themselves from a hack, in case of loss or forget your seed, or even to protect yourself from the famous $5 wrench attack. The use of the Metamask and Ledger combo allows to have an excellent protection but it is possible to go even further with the multisig, that I discovered thanks to Gnosis Safe. 

*I promise you I‚Äôm not paid but I just wanted to share something I discovered recently and wanted to talk about something I know and use so don‚Äôt hate me for repeating a thousand times ‚ÄúGnosis Safe‚Äù.*

Gnosis Safe allows the creation of a portfolio via a smart contract and thus the implementation of a better security thanks to multi-signatures. This ensures that the smart contract is not controlled by a single recovery phrase or person, which means that the security of the portfolio can be spread over multiple devices. 

This means that even if one of your wallets gets hacked, lost or stolen, no transactions can be made. I can't guarantee your physical integrity or good health if you get kidnapped to give up your cryptos but at least your money will be safe.

Multisig, via Gnosis for example (there are undoubtedly several apps doing the same thing), ensures that digital assets are effectively protected while retaining agility and the ability to transact on multiple blockchains. Multisig requires that a predefined number of people or devices (such as multiple Ledgers you own) approve a transaction, preventing unauthorized access and loss of tokens. 

Side note: make sure that the people or devices that need to sign your transactions don't know each other or are not in the same place, this will prevent you from getting robbed by your family if ever, just my personal advice ;)

Moreover Gnosis Safe is compatible with almost all dApps on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum and some others, you can also use Wallectconnect, manage your NFTs, etc. so it‚Äôs pretty easy to work with this one.

Note that gas fees will be deducted when the last person validates the transaction, if the transaction is not validated, no fees will be applied.

So on Gnosis Safe it is possible to:

* Configure a multisig wallet
* Add the addresses of the portfolios whose signature is required
* Define the minimum number of signatures required, for example 2 out of 3, if one or more people/devices are not available
* Deposit tokens on the smart contract address
* Define a limit below which multi-signature will not be required
* Define a limit beyond which more signatures will be required
* Track your transactions
* And finally track the assets available on the multisig portfolio 
* Bonus: you can now sleep peacefully",CryptoCurrency

If you didnt YOLO in at ATHs over the last month, chances are you are probably up 100s of percent this year... I dont see the point in bearish selling if this is the case, as you should still be super flush RN.. so my thoughts are this- People are taking profit or removing their original investment to play with house money... 

  This is what Im thinking because over the last month at ATHs thats what I was doing myself... I have already taken out what I put in this year, and my accounts are still very green even if I hadnt... So I think people are probably taking profits out to buy lambos and holiday gifts, some people are probably also selling before the new year for tax reasons depending on where they live... I think these sales have led to some bearish selling and this has pushed it lower..

Im wondering if this is a bear trap in the making, The way I see it people are probably cashing in for the holidays, and are likely to start trading again more after the holidays/new year after showing their relatives the sweet rented lambo and semi expensive wine they bought with their profits.. 
  I may be a fool (trust me I am) but I suspect this isnt bearish selling as much as it is profit taking for the holidays and tax reasons...

I also occasionally enjoy taking surveys on BTC surveys which rewards BTC if you complete surveys.

Now onto my post:

With the dip lately I see in this sub there are two types of people, those who panic sell or those who buy the crash and hold the bag. What I dont see is that there seems to be nobody talking about Crypto faucets, and what affect they might be playing on these prices, or if crypto faucets are a sustainable idea with the volatility of prices.

For example BTC surveys values your BTC in points with one point = 0.01$ USD worth of BTC rather than the amount of BTC you actually have earned, where as Rollercoin shows you how much BTC you have earned and stockpiled. 

This makes me think about how with these crypto faucets, would it potentially be a good idea to gain some side crypto through them, and then cash out when the prices are lower so you get more bang for your buck? It also makes me wonder how sustainable these faucets are if the prices are so voaltilie?

t3_r8upbt,Are We Here? BTC 2013 Analysis,"Here is some analysis for you, during this difficult period, to provide some perspective and hope (ium?). :)

An explanation of the chart:

1. This is the weekly BTC-USD log chart. In it you can see BTC adhering to a very clear channel on the weekly timeframe, with clear points of resistance and support at the top, middle and bottom of the channel. A touch of the top usually means immediate pullback and entering of the ""bear-market"", if you want to use that term. However the midpoint in this channel is our focus. I have highlighted with a green dot every time Bitcoin broke this midpoint of resistance/support, or held it as support. I have marked with a red dot every time it met resistance and failed to break, or failed to hold it as support.
2. If we look at April 2013, BTC came up to this midpoint, tested it, failed to break, and retraced, holding the 50 EMA on the weekly as support, retested the midpoint and broke through. This breakout initiated a very strong upsurge, ending in new ATHs, and the end of that bull run.
3. Today: From Feb-May of this year, BTC tested this midpoint multiple times, failed to break through and retraced, similar to the April period of 2013. It has now held the 50 EMA as support twice, and at the moment we are seeing a third test of it, hopefully for support.

Will this retest of the 50 EMA on the weekly as support initiate BTC's final surge of this bull-market, through this resistance, and on to ATHs into late January or even February of 2022?

Here's hoping.

Now I just wish that I had invested that money on something else, or just sell when it peaked.
Fast forward to this day, still the same thing's going around. just buy &amp; hodl bro, buy &amp; hodl.

1. stay away from here unless you are here for the memes
2. only put in what u can afford to lose
3. only enter when all the crypto's are at or near the all time lows, so just wait for the right time and make your move

It's a mistake that could happen to any of us.

&amp;#x200B;

The folks at the Badger DAO discord have published a list of addresses that are still at risk. These are addresses for which it would be advisable to revoke spending permission to the attacker's address. Assuming that it's ok to put a link to a google doc here, if your address is on the following list, you're probably at risk: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10EouKIXBZnDTtgXEMP8YGwcWMf92KwixUVrclSGk520/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10EouKIXBZnDTtgXEMP8YGwcWMf92KwixUVrclSGk520/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're at risk and want to revoke permission, there are websites such as [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) and [debank.com](https://debank.com) that have tools for revoking permission. The attacker's known address is 0x1fcdb04d0c5364fbd92c73ca8af9baa72c269107. If you have a spending allowance for that address, you'll want to revoke it by setting it to 0.

Every time I put in a market order during movements, I always get my order filled with all of the worst values that were traded during the time of fill so I‚Äôve just always stuck with limit orders. Is this the same for crypto? Do you guys always use limit or is market orders a regular way you make your purchases?  

Either way for beginners, it‚Äôs very easy to learn about this function. Just some quick research to see if your exchange offers this service and look up the proper steps. 

I use Gemini for my exchange and it‚Äôs free to change the desktop mode to active trader and from there you can clearly see the order type and pick market, limit, or even other orders which are worth looking into also.

t3_r8lowr,Being a ‚Äùpaper hand‚Äù (trader) has saved me from all big crashes this year.,"I really don‚Äôt get the hate this sub is giving to people who‚Äôs trading. It‚Äôs just another investing strategy like your beloved DCA and HODL. 

May, BTC starts dropping big time from it‚Äôs ATH with shitload of FUD going on. Time to paper hand. (Sure was a bit scared when it started to rise a bit again just before the big crash. Ended up with ~70% profit. A lot of other traders/paper hands ended up with even more.

Flash crash in september with Evergrande FUD going on? Time to paper hand once more. Sell everything again. No reaction on the market when evergrande misses their second payment, things start to breaking bearish pattern in TA - buy back ~ 12% profit

Now? Oh we have shitload of FUD going around and we‚Äôre clearly in a short term bearish pattern. BTC drops 20% and having trouble clearing resistans. Paper handed at ~59k after it failed to pass 60k for the second time. Haven‚Äôt bought back yet. Will still wait a day or two. At this point it would give me ~20% profit.

And this is nowhere close to the tops on any sell. There are way better traders than me out there. But i just want to shed some light on it, that trading isn‚Äôt as bad as 99% here thinks. And following TA has worked out well for me in most cases too, even if most of you thinks it‚Äôs pure BS.

Sure trading isn‚Äôt for everybody and can be much more stressful. And losses happens every now and then too. You just have to learn to leave emotions out of it. Just like with any kind of investing.

TL;DR - Paper Handing / trading isn‚Äôt as bad as this sub want‚Äôs it to be, especially in times of a lot of FUD and instabillity.

Edit: Didn‚Äôt mean to shit on people who‚Äôs sticking to dca and hodl. I know it‚Äôs propably the best long term strategy for most people.

And if you're thinking to yourself - ""Oh those noobs! Don't they know any better?""

They do.

Because they're new so they're more cautious, checking, double checking, triple checking before they confirm. They do test transactions just to be sure. They are not distracted.

How about those who have been doing it for a while? A few months?

This is the danger zone. You have just enough experience to feel like you know what you're doing. But you don't have enough experience to know where the pitfalls are. You're cocky and you have no right to be.

Bitcoin (BTC) sellers were active on Friday, pushing the cryptocurrency toward the bottom of its weeklong price range. Lower support at about $53,000 could stabilize the current pullback.
BTC was trading at around $55,000 at press time and is down about 2% over the past 24 hours.
Upside momentum is starting to slow on the daily and weekly price charts, which means upside could be limited toward $60,000 resistance. For now, the intermediate-term uptrend remains intact given the upward sloping 100-day moving average.

It's been another week of high volatility for the broader cryptocurrency market. After intense sell-offs driven by concerns related to regulatory threats and the emergence of the coronavirus omicron variant, many leading cryptocurrencies have posted strong gains over the last seven days of trading. 

The tokens of Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), Cardano (CRYPTO:ADA), and Solana (CRYPTO:SOL) are up roughly 6.5, 3.5%, and 12.6%, respectively, over the past week as of 2:30 p.m. ET today. Resurgent bullish momentum in the crypto space after its recent volatility appears to be the biggest catalyst behind each token's gains in the past seven days, but there are also some coin-specific factors that are likely influencing the increases. 

Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano's respective tokens each differ from some other major cryptocurrencies in the sense that they're tied to application-building networks, as opposed to just functioning as currencies. It's possible that this may give them a superior fundamental valuation case compared with tokens like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Investors have been keeping a particularly close eye on how application-backed cryptocurrencies are performing relative to Bitcoin, and some are betting that a major shift could be in the works. 

With a current market capitalization of roughly $516 billion, Ethereum's ether token ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. For comparison, Bitcoin has a market cap of roughly",CryptoCurrency

t3_r89tyf,In the past 24 hours ~142k traders got liquidated for around ~800m dollars,"Today was a big flush of long positions and some short-traders positions. The total crypto space got 'rekt' for \~800m dollars in the past 24hours.

\- BTC is liquidated for \~300M dollar in regard to the total \~800M dollars.

\- The biggest liquidation was one trader losing $11.12m on DOT.

\- BTC traders lost the most cash in 24h, but ETH the past hour with \~30M liquidations compared to \~10M BTC.

What does this mean for the crypto space? Not much yet... While these numbers seem big, this flush out does not guarantee a price pump... but could be:

* On 26 October we had a slightly higher liquidation at \~900M dollars, this did not result in a direct price pump. However, we did see a new all-time at the starting days of November.
* We also saw a huge liquidation of \~3.5B dollars on 6 September. While this didn't cause BTC's price to rise directly, it did pump end of November and onwards in October (around the 19th).

But on the other hand:

* 15 November and 25 November have shown similar liquidations as happened today. Many speculators thought these two events would cause us to climb back, but this did not happen. Now we got our third liquidation in the same month.

What this all means? I honestly don't know. Positive macro indicators and flush outs of overleveraged people often mean a short term rise after the price. Hence, the calls of many analysts that this was the 'bottom' or 'last dip before the pump'.

It's very scary to say now: 'Okay this really was the true bottom', because that has pranked us all these last weeks.

Personally, I think the 100MA support around \~51k is the bottom and that these three liquidations were enough to see healthy growth in price again as we saw after the liquidations in September.

Personally my dad had a client a few years ago who was very enthusiastic about Ethereum and that snowballed into me hearing about it and becoming interested. Despite my dad loving everything to do with Ethereum I was more interested in Cardano and so put all of my savings from my part time job into it and of course now I am a very happy man.

Is it the technical side or is it the politics of it?(A big middle finger to the establishment). For me I‚Äôm still here for the financial know how.

t3_r8o6gt,What happened? Spoofing happened,"Edit: source is Willy Woo

I know we can all state the obvious that macro is a big reason for the decline since yesterday morning when BTC was 57k. From JPOW/Tapering, to evergrande, to omicron you name it. The macro environment played a role but this flash crash to 40k can be explained with spoofing. 

In laymen terms, Spoofing is a market manipulation strategy that is considered illegal in the United States but since we don‚Äôt really have regulation it‚Äôs easier to implement with crypto (even though it‚Äôs still illegal).

Spoofers create a fake demand and supply of assets whereby they make a massive amount of limit orders on one side of the market to make it seem that is where the market will head too. With Spoofers bidding/limit orders, they actually intend to cancel it with the intent of making a hefty profit. 

Exchanges don‚Äôt have much protection against this and I can‚Äôt answer why (maybe they benefit?) that is especially when BitMEX founders were arrested because spoofing was common on that exchange. 

This happened to BTC at the end of November when we saw a bit of a rebound and Spoofers set limit orders below that level and then pulled out and set the price above the rebound. Hence now we are here hoping we can recover, hoping for 50k at EOD to keep things really bullish.",CryptoCurrency

t3_r7giy8,I'm Convinced Porn Coins are Going to Be the Next Big Thing,"#Porn Coins: The Next Big Thing

Dog Coins. Pixelated monkey JPEG NFTs. The Metaverse. These are the ""in thing"" right now, but their time will pass as the hype fades. What do people use every day? Sometimes multiple times a day? Right now? What will never go away and will always have a market? 

#Porn

The internet may never have reached mainstream status if it wasn't for pornography. Globally, the adult entertainment is a $97 Billion dollar industry and the internet brought porn to people quickly, easily, and (relatively) anonymously. Crypto can take it a step further by providing platforms and secure payments for the content producers and untold potential improvements available in Web 3.0.

&amp;nbsp;

Today, AVN stopped monetization on their platform due to discrimination from banks. People say it all the time incorrectly, but in this case, ""crypto can fix this."" If you consume pornography, do what you can to support the performers. Crypto can genuinely improve their lives. [Source: AVN Website](https://avn.com/business/articles/technology/avn-stars-gayvn-stars-to-discontinue-monetization-features-903845.html)

&amp;nbsp;


For perspective: Imagine if OnlyFans minted, accepted, or backed a decentralized crypto. Imagine if reddit nsfw subs also allowed tipping in it. That's the potential we're talking about here.

*******************

###SpankChain

SpankChain is a cryptocurrency payment processor that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The aim is to build an economic and technical infrastructure for the porn industry. To bring the core benefits of blockchain, such as privacy, security, economic efficiency, and self-sovereign identity, to the porn industry.

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, SpankChain partnered with JustFor.Fans, an adult entertainment industry fan platform to build SpankyPay. The newly created platform will help users to make payments instantly using cryptocurrencies like BTC, LTC, ETH, etc. Ameen Soleimani founded SpankChain.

###Bitcci

Bitcci is made up of a group of public stock companies located in the cryptovalley of
Lichtenstein and Switzerland (I'm bullish on anything crypto that is Swiss-based). Founded by Christoph Elbert in 2017, the bitcci Group AG is building an entirely new global ecosystem for the next-generation sex industry.

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcci's mission is to make the adult entertainment industry legal, safe, and free for anyone who wants to enjoy it. Several bitcci projects will be going live: portals, apps, and other IT solutions in the Q4 of 2021.

###WankCoin

WankCoin is a cryptocurrency token project built to offer secure and anonymous adult site transactions. It is the leading adult entertainment cryptocurrency and is accepted on over 100 adult entertainment websites. WankCoin is a digital currency built on the Ethereum blockchain. With WankCoin, adult entertainment lovers can enjoy themselves while enjoying their anonymity. Unlike most cryptocurrencies today that doesn‚Äôt have real-world applications, WankCoin is officially accepted as a means of payment across more than 100 pornography websites.

###Bitcoin Adult (BTAD)

Bitcoin Adult (BTAD) is a fast, private, secure proof-of-stake community-driven cryptocurrency project. The goal of BTAD is to become the ultimate payment solution for the porn industry. Bitcoin Adult crypto project was launched without ICO funding. The project's main objective is to create an adult cryptocurrency, which people will earn while they watch porn. It is also designed to offer a scalable and sustainable alternative to Bitcoin. BTAD uses proof-of-stake with masternodes for the network‚Äôs security.

###PornVisory

PornVisory is a cryptocurrency porn startup based on a decentralized, flexible organization (DFO) standard. Aside from allowing users access to adult content, PornVisory also provides reviews on the most interesting and hot videos, porn news, and rankings. Users can pay anonymously to enjoy adult entertainment without having their identity revealed. By leveraging the Basic Attention Token (BAT) project concept, the PornVisory team seeks to reward users for spending time on their platform. Based on this sub's obsession with BAT, this is going to appeal to a lot of users here.

###Conclusion

You want more and better porn, right?

1. These coins/platforms allow for anonymity
2. These coins/platforms allow for security
3. When performers are safer and compensated, they'll make more content

*************
TL;DR - Porn coins haven't blasted off yet. I'm betting the explosion will come soon. Don't act surprised when it hits you in the face.

As you can tell, we just experienced a substantial drop. Many coins averaging 25-30% in about 1 hour. BTC down $15K in 24 hours and about $9K in the big one hour drop. 

Analysts such as Plan B had estimates for BTC 100K by the end of November. Many predicted 100K by the end of year. As we could see by tonight. ANYTHING could happen, and we could see a huge upswing. I‚Äôm not going to put end of year predictions down at all. We still have more than 25 days left, anything could happen. This is the casino after all.

The reason I‚Äôm mentioning analytics is because in the end of the day, NOBODY knows.

t3_r7n8yd,Tax Tidbits From a CPA (US),"Without doxxing myself, I've been a CPA (specifically,  a tax accountant) in the US for about 10 years.  Recently at my firm, I've been included in a small group of professionals forming a network of crypto tax consultants and specialists.  As I truly love the crypto community, the best contribution to this sub I can think of is to try to 1) put together a few tax tidbits and 2) to answer every tax question that I can in the comments.  Reading alot of comments and posts in the sub, I'm a bit concerned that my fellow crypto enthusiasts are going to put themselves at risk of the IRS by not fully understanding the extent of their activities.  Now before I start answering, I'll add that anything I say should be used as a guide to either do further research on your own to understand your tax situation as it relates to crypto, or to acknowledge that your tax situation may be over your head and you should seek out a tax professional.  There are tax resources such as koinly, and while I don't use them personally,  I believe they are worth the investment - but I also want people to understand their own tax situation to make sure any paid service is handling your situation correctly. 

Without further adieu,  here are a few items of general knowledge and feel free to ask questions below and I'll try to answer everything (I'm operating under the assumption this post will generate probably 25 comments, so if for some reason it blows up, be patient and I'll try to get to everything). This will also be entirely US specific, anyone outside of the US, I'm sorry but I'm in no position to give tax opinions.

1) Your exchange, wallet, etc will likely not issue you a 1099-B for your trading activity, so don't count on getting any help from them, other than your transaction details. This won't be required for a few years and was part of the infrastructure bill.

2) Every crypto you swap, exchange, convert, sell, earn lending/bonding reward, mine, earn staking rewards, receive airdrops on is a taxable event in the current year. 

3) To emphasize the point above, this includes MOONS. Yes, all of those MOONS you receive via karma distribution should be picked up on your tax return. Same as BAT rewards by using Brave.

4) The value you pick up on any rewards, mining, staking, airdrops, faucets is the fair market value at the time of receipt. You should be tracking this on your own or using a service. 

5) The amount you pick up into income is now your basis. Basis is ""cost"".

6) Mining is considered self-employment income and should be reported on Schedule C, which differs from staking which would be picked up as other income,  along with the other items not including selling, swapping, exchanging.

7) Sending a crypto from one wallet or exchange to another is not a taxable event  - though you should track your transaction fees to include in your basis.

8) NFTs are treated the same way as everything above. 

9) Keep good records.  If you do not maintain good records or lose them and are not able to substantiate your cost basis, the IRS could make it $0, which would increase taxes you owe.

10) Holding period can give tax benefits. If you sell something you've held for a year, it's a long term capital gain and is taxed at preferential rates. Less than a year is at ordinary rates.

11) You are supposed to report the date purchased, date sold, cost, and sales proceeds of EVERY sell (exchange, sell, swap). Even if this results in $0 gain or loss.

12) Wash sale rules don't apply, however, selling something and immediately buying it back for tax loss harvesting could violate economic substance rules and on audit, the loss could be disallowed (it would likely be incorporated back into your basis).

13) Monero won't save you from paying taxes. Nor will boating accidents.

14) You can trade crypto using crypto/bitcoin IRAs and the gains are tax free,  but you can't pull out until retirement.  I don't utilize these services, but they exist. 

That's what I can think of for the time being, I'll make an edit if anything else important pops into my head.  I hope this and any questions provide some useful information to people in this sub. Best of luck to all!

TLDR: Taxes are hard, if you don't have your arms around it, seek a professional and bite the bullet and pay.  Feel free to ask tax questions below and I'll answer what I can.

Edit:

15) Earning rewards via a debit card like coinbase is NOT taxable.  It is considered a purchase discount.  You would have no income to report and your basis would be the value of the coin when received.

16) April 15th is a ways away, so you should use time now to start gathering all of your data.  If for some reason you can't get all of your data by 4/15, you can file a Form 4868 which will extend your tax due date to October 15th (you still have to pay all of your taxes you expect to owe by 4/15 - the 4868 just gives you time to finalize your return).

17) To expand on the mining bullet earlier,  as it's considered a business, you are able to take deductions against the mining income (equipment [bonus depreciation is your friend], electricity, other supplies). This will offset some of the tax impact especially in the early going.

18) If you had crypto gains you didn't report from Tax Year 2017 and earlier, it's likely those audit windows are closed, though some exceptions apply.

19) Staking presents unique challenges as sometimes rewards are earned by the minute.  There is no way to calculate income on this by the minute and I consider anything less than monthly to be an undue burden. For my personal taxes, I calculate income from staking rewards, like ALGO, monthly. I take my total rewards for the month and multiply them by a price from coinmarketcap around midnight.  I do this consistently with all of my coins and feel it's a reasonable and fair method. 

Lastly, this post blew up with questions, which is great because I'm happy knowing I'm helping alot of you. With that said, it's taking more time than I planned to get to everyone's question, especially with a wife and young kids - but I still plan on answering every questions on this thread, so if I haven't gotten to you yet, rest assured I will be in the next few days.

t3_r8jilc,How to survive the incoming(?)Bear Market,"1. **Do not PANIC SELL:** One of the biggest mistakes investors do in times like this is they start reacting emotionally rather than rationally.  Investors should try to always separate their emotions from the investment decision-making process. What seems like a massive global catastrophe one day may be remembered as nothing more than a blip on the radar screen a few years down the road. Remember that fear is an emotion that can cloud the rational judgment of a situation. 
2. **Analyze your Inventory:**  If you bought a bunch of shitcoins/meme coins, you just might be better off selling them. Your inventory must have at least 60% in BTC and ETH since they have proved time and time again their long-term resilience.
3. **Do not spend more than you can afford to lose:** Don't sell your house or do something rash. Yes, buying the dip is a good strategy but that doesn't mean you take several loans for the same.
4. **Take everything you read with a grain of salt** (Yes, even this post): Do not take someone else's word as gospel, do what you think is right(It is your money after all). This a time when scammers are especially active since they know that people are jumpy and emotional. Be wary of those DMs and people who say they can help you without asking/expecting anything in return.
5.  **Keep calm and HODL:** Don't get too hassled with this wild rollercoaster that we are experiencing. Buy the dip if you can otherwise cling to your assets and pray to Satoshi. A digital detox might do you some good if you have a habit of checking prices every 5 seconds.
6. **Dollar Cost Averaging:** The most important thing to keep in mind during an economic slowdown is that it's normal for the cryptoverse to have negative years‚Äîit's¬†part of the business cycle. If you are a long-term investor (meaning a time horizon of 10+ years), one option is to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging¬†(DCA). By purchasing shares regardless of price, you end up buying coins at a low price when the market is down. Over the long run, your cost will ""average down,"" leaving you with a better overall entry price for your coins.

This does really help if you're a paper hand and you tend to sell the dip. I've done that before, not during every dip, but in the beginning I always thought: Oh noo this is the bear market.

And while it could be that we're entering a bear market now, there are no indicators that are telling me that, apart from the price going down.

Bitcoin dominance didn't shoot up yet (this would be a sign of the beginning of a bear market), so so far it's all good.

Yes, we have to wait a little longer to become rich, but that's fine. If we hold the line around these levels, then we can soon fly again.

Am I scared? Well, I could lose half of my money, I think that would be the worst case scenario here. Best case is we go to the moon, so I take that risk/reward.

Studies have shown that crypto is used less for crime than normal fiat as a proportion of total transactions, so the criminal argument doesn't hold up either. Crypto is actually a very bad way to do crime, since your transactions are on the blockchain for anyone to see. That's unless you're using monero, however.

t3_r86mqt,Why IOTA Will Evolve Cryptocurrency To Another Lever; Welcome Assembly,"First of all I have to say I was quite sceptical and to be honest confused when the annoucement came out and listened to the AMA in the hope to understand what was going on.

I have to say wow. This is HUGE and could very well make IOTA! This update is fundamentally required to the system.

To help others who are confused here are my notes. I have tried to structure them although the points weren't discussed in this order. I have sprinkled some of my own initial thoughts in.

Why Assembly?

Assembly is required to allow permissionless smart contracts. This cannot really be done on IOTA mainnet or Shimmer. Some people may not have realised this.

So for those that ask the main difference between the IOTA mainet and Assembly is permissioned v permissionless smart contracts. In ISCP, if someone wants to set up a smart contract chain they have to define who the validators are etc. In Assembly, you do not. Anyone can be a validator. Taking it back to IOTA's true original vision that we signed up for. A decentralised, free, trustless network.

Goverments (interesting that Dom specifically mentioned ‚ÄúGovernments‚Äù) and companies can still set up permissioned chains on ISCP if they want to. So not all smart contracts will run through Assembly. However, all Defi projects will be on Assembly.

Anyone can be a validator. Theoretically, people can run their own SC validator farms.

Finally, a key reason for using a new token and not just IOTA is the network‚Äôs reward and punishment structure for validators. For it to be decentralised, you have to incentivise validators to support and secure the network. To this the IF will have to mint new tokens to give as rewards and potentially to slash token benefits as a punishment to rogue/ bad validators. The IF realise the community will not accept lots of new IOTA being minted. Hence a new token is required.

Formation/ Structure of Assembly

More than a dozen venture capital and funders are involved and have pledged to invest in Assembly. These early investors will get 10% of Assembly tokens. They will be revealed soon. Although I see Hyperchain Capital on Twitter who also invested in Fantom are following Assembly and are tweeting about Assembly. Make of that what you will.

The IF chose the early investors very carefully. They had to believe in the system and help with BUIDL philosphy (i.e support the devs and dapps).

The VC and funders are bringing funds, devs and other dapps from other ecosystems. IF are are in talks with devs from other ecosystems and even more funders . But most of the dapps are likely to wait until mainnet to port over. This is likely exciting for funders as they can get in at ground zero.

Devs get access to 40% of the tokens. Dom stated this will be one of the biggest Dev funds in the space.¬†Current Devs won‚Äôt have to refactor their current work much and it will just be a reconfiguration change.¬†Which should be minor.

Dom was frank and stated that not having a premine¬†for IOTA has held it back a lot compared to other cryptos that have millions of dollars to sponsor F1 etc. The IF have only worked with donations and sponsorship and grants so far. The IF has earned its trusted reputation this way. But the IF wants to make as big impact as possible. With Assembly they can do a lot more and it is needed.¬†

I think they have approached this in a balanced way.

How Assembly will work

Assembly smart contract nodes will basically be WASP nodes (current smart contract nodes) with a few tweaks, so not much work do there for the IF.

Assembly is to run on IOTA not Shimmer, but it may happen in the future.

Assembly is 90% ISCP. So they are not reinventing the wheel with Assembly. This will save a lot of work and lead time.

Reception

IF has spoke with a lot of other major authorities in the space on this (Dom mentioned ETH community) a lot were really interested. Dom stated they wouldn't set up a separate network unless there was a real interest from partners and Devs on this. I think the new reward and punishment system for validators is key.

The IF is already speaking with two stable coin providers to support Assembly.

How does Assembly give IOTA value?

Assembly will be IOTA‚Äôs main source of adoption in the cryptosphere(Dom repeated this several times). Think of it as a major new use case. Your IOTA token is your key to the new decentralised network. Further, you need IOTA tokens to be a validator on Assembly. Validator gets rewards. This gives MIOTA even more value on top of any corporate adoption.

Updates on Assembly Progress so far

There has been one bridge built so far.

Assembly or Shimmer likely won't be released this year (""this year is almost over""). However, getting Shimmer and Assembly up and running is now IF's main focus. I think it will be Q1 2022. ¬†

""Assembly will probably launch on Chrysalis.""

You can already start building for Assembly now. IF providing support now. Will be ready for Assembly if it works on ISCP.

Tokenomics

Will provide more information on tokenomics next week.¬†

What sets Assembly apart

Permissionless smart contracts, with a free base layer. Amazing interoerability. It‚Äôs claim to fame will be flexibility. Anyone setting up can set a chain and define validation rules, fee and incentive structures. Validators can either accept or reject the request. This opens up the path for their to be 0 fee smart contracts.

You may ask why would Validators agree to this? Well, validators can be incentivised by receiving a separate token. Dom gave the example of a dex . It has its own token which it gives to validators in exchanges for doing SC for free. Great new strategies for businesses.

Tokens will be able to move freely and effortlessly between chains. Smart contract shards will be able to share resources.

Miner Extractable Value is not an issue on Assembly unlike some other SC protocols. This is huge as we already have the solution that many large SC protocols are struggling with.

Other Points not related to Assembly

IOTA FOUNDATION (IF) now have close to 200 people and still hiring a lot.¬†

IF are still not slowing down their corporate adoption arm. This will still continue and is a key focus. Zebra and Trademark East Africa has expanded a lot in the last month.¬†I am not too sure what this meant but sounded interesting.

TLDR: This is vital and huge in the next stage of IOTA.

t3_q180qz,We are changing how you post on r/Futurology by requiring Submission Statements with each post.,"From now on we will be implementing a new rule on r/Futurology, that posters seed their post with an initial comment, a Submission Statement, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future. A Mod may sticky this comment so that it appears ahead of the other comments.

We hope this will cut down on low-effort posts, especially those where the future-focused aspect of the discussion is unclear. At present many posts receive few upvotes and none or almost no comments.

We anticipate requiring Submission Statements will reduce the number of posts overall but increase the quality of the discussions in the comments section. As we want these statements to initiate genuine insightful discussion we‚Äôd ask they be a minimum of 60 words (300 characters). Again this is to weed out low-effort posting.

We know from speaking to Moderators of other subreddits who have gone this route that it will be a gradual iterative process and it will take time for people to get used to it. 

This will be a big change for us all and we‚Äôd especially ask our regular posters to be patient with us. We always reply to Modmail‚Äôs but you can reach us on Discord too and the Mod Team are always open to dialogue.

We feel the best of this subreddit is the discussions in the comments section. As such, the goal here is to improve standards so that as much as possible we only have intelligent, insightful future-focused discussion and eliminate the rest.",Futurology

t3_qyhmn5,"Monsters of the id, or how we have forgotten to deal with our demons, how they are empowered by technology, and what to expect in the future.","When I started researching the **opposing group mechanics** on social media, I initially thought it came from cultural and subcultural differences, different values, and of course what we have seen in the documentary the social network, that ai tries to boost controversy by feeding information to users that opposes their values, beliefs, and opinions.

There was a **missing link**, since big groups are formed around misinformation. That missing link is the gut feeling. Many people communicate online very differently than they do in real life, sometimes it is a sort of venting. Like you would complain about a friend to another friend, but don't do in his face to not hurt his feelings, or to even just see what the other friend says if it's even socially acceptable what you're feeling.

Sometimes it is a lot worse than that, a bad day, and the worst of your feelings , which otherwise would stay buried under you **conscious mind**, since it is not socially acceptable, are now sometimes posted online.

It was already noticeable in the **dawn of the internet**, the worst things were said online, yet no one really cared that much, it was in the realm of the internet, and in the back of peoples minds they knew it was just shittalk so to speak, it also didn't have enough coverage to take it into account. 

That changed when the coverage and the **spreading power** increased, especially when the latter came to a point where it is no longer controllable, a good example is a post I saw the other day about a shool teacher, parents were asking to post pictures of shoolactivities within a private social media group of the shool.

Sooner or later pictures were tagged and shared outside the group, and some parents started opposing the pictures, after a decade of fighting between amongst each other, the school decided to **not use the platform anymore.**

But there is another factor that is essential when researching the opposing group mechanics that contains groups around misnformation.

That factor is real identity, real identity on the platform changes a key element in group mechanics, it is an element needed for **group conformity** beyond reason. These mechanics have been proven in the experiments of ash and milgram. 

They both proved that the majority of people will conform to a group if they have became part of it even if it supersedes reason.

**Ash**: Giving the wrong answer to a question (even while the correct answer is obvious) because the group gives the wrong answer

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch\_conformity\_experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments)

**Milgram:** torturing an individual , even to the point of death, because an authority requires it.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram\_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)

Lastly there is another factor, and that is that **propaganda** is more effective when there is an overflow of information. People will simplify information to understand, and by that also believe it quicker , this is proved by nobel prize winner Herbert A simon

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion\_in\_Social\_psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion_in_Social_psychology)

It is the identity, the spreading power, the group conformity mechanics, the propaganda mechaniscs and the lack of filter when communicating what creates  the perfect storm to form groups around misinformation, and what is the limit.

Well we have a flat earth, and vaccins are dangerous, even when something exists like polio, and that there is no reason to make people believe the earth is a globe when it isn't.  There have been wars as well...

t3_qygal1,Is progress too fast for human evolution?,"It seems like that humans have certain social structures that make for a happy life. Having meaning, friends, relationships, spirituality all contribute to the well being of a person. But with technology's advancement the basic needs that we require to survive such as food, water, shelter are increasingly more equalized among the population. With that we don't need each other as much as we used to and this naturally makes our relations to one another more of a choice than a need for survival. With that we get echo chambers around the web since we can get our ideas validated instantly by someone else and we can ignore the ""nay-sayers"" (also self-growth opportunities) completely and just surround ourselves with like-minded thinkers (who also limit our scope for growth). This leads to polarization and then it takes away from much needed structures that create a healthy environment for children to socialize and learn what it means to have healthy relationships. Would these iterations on each generation where slow decay of social structures and the increasing ease of individual survival bring society to a point where population decline will occur not because of any disease, natural disaster, limitation of resource but just because we lose the desire to interact with one another?

t3_qxajn4,We are being controlled and nobody is talking about it...,"Is it just me or is Social media controling most people and influencing their everyday lives to a point were their passions and drive for existing is being slowly stripped from themselves unwillingly. Leaving them with an unfilfilling feeling each day that can only be temporarly satisfied by pulling up your phone and clicking around social media apps. 

Who do we have to blame for this? The platform or the people within the platforms?

Dont get me wrong influencers are powerful figures and can bring  of good into this world, but they can also cause alot of harm. 

Instagram is known to be harmful with its dopamine driven content display. These platforms are designed to keep you on their platform to drive revenue from advertisement space. But at the end of the day, that all it is... a platform that shows content and advertises. People blame the platform, but isnt it the controling nature of the people within the platform thats creating harm?

The people who body shame, degrade and make people feel lesser then themselves by showing highlights of their day. As a society a majority of us reward this kind of behavior by providing them our attention and likes and comments, thus moving them up the ranks. 

I believe these platforms are changing social evolution faster than we want it to. In a matter of years we went from an age of having to physically meet someone to get to know who they are and what their social status is, to an enviroment where you don't need to even talk to someone to get a feel of who they are and what they like to do.

Such micromanagement will be godlike in nature with the world state being totally omniscient of every move of every world citizen. Total state omniscience will be achieved with a mass surveillance apparatus that will be similar to the one Oceania had from 1984, but much more high tech and efficient (in the way of Communist China, but many times more high tech and all encompassing).

Plus, industrial processes are not outfitted for the use of electricity, but are already designed to be powered by fuels. This is where hydrogen fuel steps in.

""Green"" hydrogen is the use of renewable energy to electrolyze, or create hydrogen. This video shows how a company that uses concentrated solar power (CSP), which directs mirrors at a collection tower for both heat and electricity (steam) production. The companies claim the high-heat method is 45% more efficient than using solar PV for hydrogen electrolysis.",Futurology

t3_qt4uzc,INTO THE METAVERSE: Fears and fantasies,"I am fascinated and concerned after seeing Facebook Connect's presentation about the upcoming metaverse.  For the uninitiated, it's basically a vision of the future, in which we are living a large chunk of our lives in virtual reality, with the use of VR headsets, which, I think, are still in their infancy.  In this vision of the future, you'd be able to live, work, and play in a virtual space all the time.  In fact, there are quite a few people who are already doing this.  Apps like VR Chat on the Oculus headset already allow the user to spend pretty much all day with their friends online, playing games.  There are already business meetings taking place on virtual headsets on a regular basis.  And you wouldn't believe the ""adult entertainment"" already available on this technology‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶not that I would know, of course.  

Within my age group, I consider myself one of the early adopters of new technology, at least when it became affordable, as Oculus Quest headsets certainly are.  During the lockdown, I invested in a VR headset and set up a fancy computer with a high-end graphics card to create the best possible VR experience, and I was blown away.  It is way more advanced than I had anticipated.  It isn't the gimmicky 80's headsets at Disneyworld.  You can now create fairly immersive realities in a virtual space, but the resolution of this reality depends on how much money you have to blow on fancy hardware, which sets up an interesting problem.  People with more money to spend on VR will be the ones with an advantage, and that already sets up a socioeconomic disparity. I was thinking that VR may be the solution to the inequities everyone is always clammering on about, but nah.  

I am still excited about its potential, but there are concerns, both obvious and not-so-obvious.  Obviously, VR technology has a long way to go.  You are still trapped in these clunky, headache-inducing, mediocre-resolution goggles that are way more impressive than they used to be, but are hardly good enough to be considered indistinguishable from reality.  The 3D effect experienced by these goggles is based on primitive overlay technology, rather than true 3D.  Avatars are boxy and legless.  Facial expressions aren't really there yet, but are coming.  Everything looks rendered on a computer, although a few high-end experiences, like Half-Life Alyx, are truly-mind blowing.  The field of view is only about 120 degrees even on the best headsets.  In other words, it is real enough to be a fun distraction, but hardly real enough to be reality.  

That brings me to another point.  Our abstractions of reality in a digital realm are, by definition, going to be limited.  It is always going to be an approximation of our limited experience, and not the whole of reality.  Most of reality we don't even understand, and a lot of our subjective experience is untranslatable, yet we are taking the tiny portion of reality that we THINK we understand, and confining someone else's perception to that very narrow window.  That's why it always feels like something is missing, no matter how convincing the VR is.  There are levels of perception that are occurring all the time that we don't have the language or technology for yet, but it may be coming.  We just don't know what it is yet.  It is a terrible fate to limit one's experience of the universe into someone else's narrow vision of it.  We are trapped enough in our own lives as it is, and now we risk being trapped in someone else's.  

Allowing someone else‚Äôs selective, biased, and possibly manipulative interpretation of reality is sort of terrifying.  We already do this on social media.  Imagine the potential of an immersive virtual space where every object in your field of view and every interaction with every virtual person and object is specifically designed to make you see things a certain way.  If a toxic comment on Instagram can drive someone to suicide, or simply ruins someone‚Äôs day, imagine what it can do in virtual reality.  

Actually you don‚Äôt have to imagine.  Just look at all the layers of abstraction we have accumulated through our social evolution, layer upon layer bringing more levels of delusion and opacification with it.  Languages, societies, print, radio, TV, gaming, social media, and now VR.  We already don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore.  This is just the next logical step.  

I‚Äôm not opposed to any of this technology.  In fact, I‚Äôm a fan of it.  What I worry about is imposing this technology on a generation that has yet to find firm footing in reality.  If you are raised almost entirely in a mentally-contrived reality (which everyone is, to different degrees), with no space for silence and creativity, your cognitive capacity and potential is forever confined to a prison that wasn‚Äôt even your idea.  You are cut off from your innate capacities, trapped in someone else‚Äôs dream ‚Äî or nightmare.

Our capacities extend beyond merely mental abstraction, although abstractions are a big part of our unique human intelligence.  Our bodies are also thinking, feeling, sensing apparatuses that we hardly pay attention to, much to our detriment.  We create our experiences with the entirety of our being, not merely our brains.  VR works on the presumption that our minds are all there is.  

Much of what we experience, we don‚Äôt quite understand, but we think we do, and then use that incomplete understanding to create what we think is a comprehensive version of reality.  We aren‚Äôt brains inside vats, not yet.  We are just cogs in a grand cosmic mechanism we don‚Äôt quite understand.  To view oneself as a unique egoic identity, and create a universe based on such a flawed premise, is ass-backwards, arrogant, lonely, and miserable.",Futurology

t3_qm2qkr,Do multipurpose helmets with complex integrated tech deserve a place in the future? How feasible and worthwhile such a technology would be?,"Now, I'm not even sure how to better refer to this sort of helmet. Whenever I try to surf google for similar concepts I can't seem to find anything like it, but I think it's a great concept. I've been fantasizing on this topic for quite a long time and would like to hear your opinions.  


**What it is.**

I imagine it as a helmet that completely covers the head (face, too). Bonus points if you can make the space inside airtight. There are several cameras located outside the helmet (two or more) that broadcast the image in real time either on screens, like in VR glasses, or through lenses directly into the eye, like in Google Glass. Across the surface there are different mounts and rails for various modifications. 

**Possible modifications and functions.**

For example, you could arrange two wide-angle cameras on the sides and thus provide the user a wider field of view than that of a human eye. Theoretically, you could even make a circular 360 degree view (as in you'd see it all at once, not by turning your head), but your eyes and perception would have to get used to it. Surely you could also implement different types of cameras. For example a separate side-mounted module with another camera with powerful optical zoom.

Thermal imagers or night vision devices could be installed, too. This is the most basic functionality. The further the more interesting. In terms of breathing, you could breathe either simply through the valve or through the filters. And if you put a couple of small balloons somewhere on your back that could temporarily provide closed-cycle breathing. Say you dive underwater or the environment becomes very toxic and filters won't work, then you can quickly switch modes and the inlet valve will close.

As for hearing, you could install several different microphones, each optimized for something different, which could significantly improve the capabilities of human hearing. Noise can be suppressed, weak sound can be amplified. Directional microphones could be used for eavesdropping. Own voice can be transmitted both pure or modified. Changes can be both cosmetic, like a different sound, or practical. For example, automatic encryption and decryption on the human side with the correct decryption code. Like, a normal person will hear a set of random sounds or noises, and a person in a helmet - comprehensive speech.

You can think of a whole bunch of other functionality for such helmet. Flashlights, sensors, sonars. No need to mention that everything that happens around can also be recorded. Or something ordinary - Internet access. Also slap the whole set of what modern AR devices can do, like placing markers in real space.

**Controls and fields of use.**

The entirety of this tech could theoretically be controlled by stuff like Neuralink chips where you spend some time getting adjusted to all the inputs/outputs until eventually it feels native, like moving your arm.

I can see military or police benefiting from such devices, though I mostly imagine them being made for personal everyday use. Such a helmet would simply ""improve"" a person, giving them a bunch of functionality with a minimum delay in use. Everything is right there, at your command.

**Summary and possible issues.**

To summarize, I imagine it as a universal device, a platform that is wearable like a helmet and that can perform a wide range of functions, from those that smartphones give us now to highly specialized ones, like something military specific. It's essentially your regular sci-fi helmet, except actually thought through. For some reason I just don't see anyone developing such things. There is stuff like F35 helmet, but that's not quite it.

Some of the drawbacks I see are that in case of personal use, legalization difficulties could arise. Facial recognition systems would become useless. In general a lot of stuff would have to change. Such a device would also likely be expensive as heck. Probably $5-15k without all the advanced modules. It would likely also require a powerful energy source and effective heat dissipation.

What are your thoughts? Do you think such a device could become feasible in the future? Would it even have any use?",Futurology

A computer on a basic scale makes computations based on ones and zeros or electrical on and offs, and a brain on a basic level makes computations based on neurons firing electrical signals and by transmitting chemicals. and by this mean would it not be possible for humans to incorporate ways in which the brain process information into a new way of computer thinking where we can add chemicals or other means to process information that is not just zeros and ones?",Futurology

How would you go about solving all the world's problems at once?

By changing the human brain, according to Dr. Alysson Muotri, a professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine at the University of California.

Our brains mediate our entire experience of the world ‚Äî every memory, belief, perception and action passes through the brain and its nervous system.

Alysson's quest is to understand what makes human brain so unique. By making models of the brain ‚Äî growing human brain organoids from human stem cells ‚Äî Alysson and his team have built a tool that has broad applications and implications, from helping with treatment of the Zika virus to understanding the development of autism.

Alysson and I spoke about:

* What is it that makes us uniquely human? ‚Äî \[0:00\]
* Humanising neurological disorder, Oliver Sacks. ‚Äî \[1:42\]
* How Dr. Muotri went from genetics to neuroscience. ‚Äî \[2:31\]
* Understanding the spectrums of disorders like autism. ‚Äî \[6:00\]
* Modifying the human brain. ‚Äî \[8:32\]
* We all modify our brains to be more social. ‚Äî \[12:30\]
* Growing entire organisms from stem cells. ‚Äî \[13:37\]
* Using brain organoids to improve computing and artificial intelligence. ‚Äî \[17:16\]
* Speeding up human evolution. ‚Äî \[21:03\]

t3_qcovq7,Do you think using genetic engineering to make everyone gorgeous is ethical?,"I think about this from time to time. We all have our little imperfections, but we are not all created equal. We may pretend it's what's inside that counts but we all know, if we are honest with ourselves, that looks matter, a lot.

Most of us are not particularly attractive, but just as well most of us are just a few steps away from being attractive.

If we could use technologies like CRISPR to edit people's dna (and imagining we had some way to kickstart the body into reshaping itself after the development has ended) should we do it? 

Aside all technological hazards. If we could do it safely, would it be a morally right thing to do?

Making everyone ""easy on the eyes"" would not only equalise the playing field, forcing people to actually develop a good personality, rather then relying on looks alone, but also make everyone happier in general. We humans love beauty, and while we accept each other as imperfect and plain as we tend to be that's because we have no choice.

I can see some arguments against it, ""when everyone's special no one will be"" and all that, and people getting into an endless chase for perfection, sure. But to me that sounds like an argument that we should not solve world hunger because everyone can't eat gourmet meals every day.

And while this issue seems trivial compared to oft quoted genetic diseases, it's undeniable truth that body image issues plague a very significant portion of the population, that it causes depression and feelings of lower value, and that people just don't treat you the same if you are not considered conventionally attractive.

And while it's tempting to say to heck with everyone, i am who i am, at this point in time that's really our only choice. But what if it wasn't? What if everyone could look just the way they imagine themselves, is it ethical to do that?",Futurology

t3_qcak9h,Why Aren't More People more worried about Quantum Computing?,"Math student here. The other day I had a conversation with my cryptography professor about qubits. For those that know, modern encryption is based off of the Diffie-Hellman public key exchange, which is impossible to brute force using computers that store info in binary. However, quantum computing CAN do so. Most people use this argument as a talking point to crap on cryptocurrencies, but NONE of those people talk about what this means for other encrypted technologies! PGP or GPG are then also breakable, making EVERY ENCRYPTED EMAIL EVER capable of getting hacked by brute force alone! If the crypto space fails to make a breakthrough and Quantum computing comes out BEFORE we figure out how to encrypt in qubits, then that basically means Google, Amazon, Facebook, and any other large tech company invested in quantum computing will have ridiculous unchecked power immediately upon finishing a first model and the regular netizen is royally screwed. This isn't being talked about enough, considering how soon quantum computing is supposed to be capable by.

We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future. A Mod may sticky this comment so that it appears ahead of the other comments.

We hope this will cut down on low-effort posts, especially those where the future-focused aspect of the discussion is unclear. At present many posts receive few upvotes and none or almost no comments.

We anticipate requiring Submission Statements will reduce the number of posts overall but increase the quality of the discussions in the comments section. As we want these statements to initiate genuine insightful discussion we‚Äôd ask they be a minimum of 60 words (300 characters). Again this is to weed out low-effort posting.

We know from speaking to Moderators of other subreddits who have gone this route that it will be a gradual iterative process and it will take time for people to get used to it. 

This will be a big change for us all and we‚Äôd especially ask our regular posters to be patient with us. We always reply to Modmail‚Äôs but you can reach us on Discord too and the Mod Team are always open to dialogue.

We feel the best of this subreddit is the discussions in the comments section. As such, the goal here is to improve standards so that as much as possible we only have intelligent, insightful future-focused discussion and eliminate the rest.",Futurology

t3_qyhmn5,"Monsters of the id, or how we have forgotten to deal with our demons, how they are empowered by technology, and what to expect in the future.","When I started researching the **opposing group mechanics** on social media, I initially thought it came from cultural and subcultural differences, different values, and of course what we have seen in the documentary the social network, that ai tries to boost controversy by feeding information to users that opposes their values, beliefs, and opinions.

There was a **missing link**, since big groups are formed around misinformation. That missing link is the gut feeling. Many people communicate online very differently than they do in real life, sometimes it is a sort of venting. Like you would complain about a friend to another friend, but don't do in his face to not hurt his feelings, or to even just see what the other friend says if it's even socially acceptable what you're feeling.

Sometimes it is a lot worse than that, a bad day, and the worst of your feelings , which otherwise would stay buried under you **conscious mind**, since it is not socially acceptable, are now sometimes posted online.

It was already noticeable in the **dawn of the internet**, the worst things were said online, yet no one really cared that much, it was in the realm of the internet, and in the back of peoples minds they knew it was just shittalk so to speak, it also didn't have enough coverage to take it into account. 

That changed when the coverage and the **spreading power** increased, especially when the latter came to a point where it is no longer controllable, a good example is a post I saw the other day about a shool teacher, parents were asking to post pictures of shoolactivities within a private social media group of the shool.

Sooner or later pictures were tagged and shared outside the group, and some parents started opposing the pictures, after a decade of fighting between amongst each other, the school decided to **not use the platform anymore.**

But there is another factor that is essential when researching the opposing group mechanics that contains groups around misnformation.

That factor is real identity, real identity on the platform changes a key element in group mechanics, it is an element needed for **group conformity** beyond reason. These mechanics have been proven in the experiments of ash and milgram. 

They both proved that the majority of people will conform to a group if they have became part of it even if it supersedes reason.

**Ash**: Giving the wrong answer to a question (even while the correct answer is obvious) because the group gives the wrong answer

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch\_conformity\_experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments)

**Milgram:** torturing an individual , even to the point of death, because an authority requires it.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram\_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)

Lastly there is another factor, and that is that **propaganda** is more effective when there is an overflow of information. People will simplify information to understand, and by that also believe it quicker , this is proved by nobel prize winner Herbert A simon

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion\_in\_Social\_psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion_in_Social_psychology)

It is the identity, the spreading power, the group conformity mechanics, the propaganda mechaniscs and the lack of filter when communicating what creates  the perfect storm to form groups around misinformation, and what is the limit.

Well we have a flat earth, and vaccins are dangerous, even when something exists like polio, and that there is no reason to make people believe the earth is a globe when it isn't.  There have been wars as well...

t3_qygal1,Is progress too fast for human evolution?,"It seems like that humans have certain social structures that make for a happy life. Having meaning, friends, relationships, spirituality all contribute to the well being of a person. But with technology's advancement the basic needs that we require to survive such as food, water, shelter are increasingly more equalized among the population. With that we don't need each other as much as we used to and this naturally makes our relations to one another more of a choice than a need for survival. With that we get echo chambers around the web since we can get our ideas validated instantly by someone else and we can ignore the ""nay-sayers"" (also self-growth opportunities) completely and just surround ourselves with like-minded thinkers (who also limit our scope for growth). This leads to polarization and then it takes away from much needed structures that create a healthy environment for children to socialize and learn what it means to have healthy relationships. Would these iterations on each generation where slow decay of social structures and the increasing ease of individual survival bring society to a point where population decline will occur not because of any disease, natural disaster, limitation of resource but just because we lose the desire to interact with one another?

t3_qxajn4,We are being controlled and nobody is talking about it...,"Is it just me or is Social media controling most people and influencing their everyday lives to a point were their passions and drive for existing is being slowly stripped from themselves unwillingly. Leaving them with an unfilfilling feeling each day that can only be temporarly satisfied by pulling up your phone and clicking around social media apps. 

Who do we have to blame for this? The platform or the people within the platforms?

Dont get me wrong influencers are powerful figures and can bring  of good into this world, but they can also cause alot of harm. 

Instagram is known to be harmful with its dopamine driven content display. These platforms are designed to keep you on their platform to drive revenue from advertisement space. But at the end of the day, that all it is... a platform that shows content and advertises. People blame the platform, but isnt it the controling nature of the people within the platform thats creating harm?

The people who body shame, degrade and make people feel lesser then themselves by showing highlights of their day. As a society a majority of us reward this kind of behavior by providing them our attention and likes and comments, thus moving them up the ranks. 

I believe these platforms are changing social evolution faster than we want it to. In a matter of years we went from an age of having to physically meet someone to get to know who they are and what their social status is, to an enviroment where you don't need to even talk to someone to get a feel of who they are and what they like to do.

I love to dream about the future as much as the next guy, but if you think the Singularity is coming next Tuesday, I've got news for you. 99.9 percent of the time, these radical inventions that people are talking about, rarely come to fruition, in our actual lifetime. I'm sure, in the year 2087, people will actually have small nano devices going through their vascular system, removing plaque. 

But my complaint, is that I heard about it in the year 2000. Back then, they did say it was a ""future"" technology, but they were talking about it being 5 to 10 years away. It's been 21 years now, and I haven't heard a single peep about it.",Futurology

It is not uncommon to hear or see people watching movies, cartoons, shows, listening to music or reading books from their youth and some get so engrossed in this that their mental health suffers.

t3_qwcf9p,"If a tyrannical world government that wanted to develop efficient interstellar travel technologies gained control of all of Earth‚Äòs resources right now, could we have that technology within our lifetimes?","Think like a tyrannical world government along the lines of Stalinist Soviet Union, but even more politically powerful (controlling the entire world) and micromanaging and bending it to its every whim and will - with brutal force if necessary by way of a highly militarized  Secret World Police. Such micromanagement will be godlike in nature with the world state being totally omniscient of every move of every world citizen. Total state omniscience will be achieved with a mass surveillance apparatus that will be similar to the one Oceania had from 1984, but much more high tech and efficient (in the way of Communist China, but many times more high tech and all encompassing).

With the world firmly in its control, this world government would then enact a series of ‚Äú5 year plans‚Äù to accelerate the development of everything from interstellar travel (the number one top priority), immortality first for elites of humanity (then eventually for all), and Star Wars/Terminator-type AI and robotic technologies. The government‚Äôs claim to legitimacy would be that humanity needs to end its endless internecine conflict within its species, unite and then focus on spreading itself across the cosmos lest it fall victim to one of many potential species ending catastrophes. 

The pursuit of these three technological goals will be absolutely relentless and ruthless in the same way that agricultural collectivization and overnight industrialization was pursued within the Soviet Union. If for example a famine occurs somewhere in North America in the midst of the world government‚Äôs singleminded pursuit of its primary goals, it will ignore it unless it is in some directly related to the achievement of the primary goal.

With all that being said, would it be scientifically possible to develop efficient interstellar travel and the other two technological breakthroughs within our lifetimes?",Futurology

Solar PV is an excellent, low cost source of electricity, but many industrialized processes require more flexible, readily available dispatch of power. Plus, industrial processes are not outfitted for the use of electricity, but are already designed to be powered by fuels. This is where hydrogen fuel steps in.

""Green"" hydrogen is the use of renewable energy to electrolyze, or create hydrogen. This video shows how a company that uses concentrated solar power (CSP), which directs mirrors at a collection tower for both heat and electricity (steam) production. The companies claim the high-heat method is 45% more efficient than using solar PV for hydrogen electrolysis.",Futurology

t3_qt4uzc,INTO THE METAVERSE: Fears and fantasies,"I am fascinated and concerned after seeing Facebook Connect's presentation about the upcoming metaverse.  For the uninitiated, it's basically a vision of the future, in which we are living a large chunk of our lives in virtual reality, with the use of VR headsets, which, I think, are still in their infancy.  In this vision of the future, you'd be able to live, work, and play in a virtual space all the time.  In fact, there are quite a few people who are already doing this.  Apps like VR Chat on the Oculus headset already allow the user to spend pretty much all day with their friends online, playing games.  There are already business meetings taking place on virtual headsets on a regular basis.  And you wouldn't believe the ""adult entertainment"" already available on this technology‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶not that I would know, of course.  

Within my age group, I consider myself one of the early adopters of new technology, at least when it became affordable, as Oculus Quest headsets certainly are.  During the lockdown, I invested in a VR headset and set up a fancy computer with a high-end graphics card to create the best possible VR experience, and I was blown away.  It is way more advanced than I had anticipated.  It isn't the gimmicky 80's headsets at Disneyworld.  You can now create fairly immersive realities in a virtual space, but the resolution of this reality depends on how much money you have to blow on fancy hardware, which sets up an interesting problem.  People with more money to spend on VR will be the ones with an advantage, and that already sets up a socioeconomic disparity. I was thinking that VR may be the solution to the inequities everyone is always clammering on about, but nah.  

I am still excited about its potential, but there are concerns, both obvious and not-so-obvious.  Obviously, VR technology has a long way to go.  You are still trapped in these clunky, headache-inducing, mediocre-resolution goggles that are way more impressive than they used to be, but are hardly good enough to be considered indistinguishable from reality.  The 3D effect experienced by these goggles is based on primitive overlay technology, rather than true 3D.  Avatars are boxy and legless.  Facial expressions aren't really there yet, but are coming.  Everything looks rendered on a computer, although a few high-end experiences, like Half-Life Alyx, are truly-mind blowing.  The field of view is only about 120 degrees even on the best headsets.  In other words, it is real enough to be a fun distraction, but hardly real enough to be reality.  

That brings me to another point.  Our abstractions of reality in a digital realm are, by definition, going to be limited.  It is always going to be an approximation of our limited experience, and not the whole of reality.  Most of reality we don't even understand, and a lot of our subjective experience is untranslatable, yet we are taking the tiny portion of reality that we THINK we understand, and confining someone else's perception to that very narrow window.  That's why it always feels like something is missing, no matter how convincing the VR is.  There are levels of perception that are occurring all the time that we don't have the language or technology for yet, but it may be coming.  We just don't know what it is yet.  It is a terrible fate to limit one's experience of the universe into someone else's narrow vision of it.  We are trapped enough in our own lives as it is, and now we risk being trapped in someone else's.  

Allowing someone else‚Äôs selective, biased, and possibly manipulative interpretation of reality is sort of terrifying.  We already do this on social media.  Imagine the potential of an immersive virtual space where every object in your field of view and every interaction with every virtual person and object is specifically designed to make you see things a certain way.  If a toxic comment on Instagram can drive someone to suicide, or simply ruins someone‚Äôs day, imagine what it can do in virtual reality.  

Actually you don‚Äôt have to imagine.  Just look at all the layers of abstraction we have accumulated through our social evolution, layer upon layer bringing more levels of delusion and opacification with it.  Languages, societies, print, radio, TV, gaming, social media, and now VR.  We already don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore.  This is just the next logical step.  

I‚Äôm not opposed to any of this technology.  In fact, I‚Äôm a fan of it.  What I worry about is imposing this technology on a generation that has yet to find firm footing in reality.  If you are raised almost entirely in a mentally-contrived reality (which everyone is, to different degrees), with no space for silence and creativity, your cognitive capacity and potential is forever confined to a prison that wasn‚Äôt even your idea.  You are cut off from your innate capacities, trapped in someone else‚Äôs dream ‚Äî or nightmare.

Our capacities extend beyond merely mental abstraction, although abstractions are a big part of our unique human intelligence.  Our bodies are also thinking, feeling, sensing apparatuses that we hardly pay attention to, much to our detriment.  We create our experiences with the entirety of our being, not merely our brains.  VR works on the presumption that our minds are all there is.  

Much of what we experience, we don‚Äôt quite understand, but we think we do, and then use that incomplete understanding to create what we think is a comprehensive version of reality.  We aren‚Äôt brains inside vats, not yet.  We are just cogs in a grand cosmic mechanism we don‚Äôt quite understand.  To view oneself as a unique egoic identity, and create a universe based on such a flawed premise, is ass-backwards, arrogant, lonely, and miserable.",Futurology

t3_qm2qkr,Do multipurpose helmets with complex integrated tech deserve a place in the future? How feasible and worthwhile such a technology would be?,"Now, I'm not even sure how to better refer to this sort of helmet. Whenever I try to surf google for similar concepts I can't seem to find anything like it, but I think it's a great concept. I've been fantasizing on this topic for quite a long time and would like to hear your opinions.  


**What it is.**

I imagine it as a helmet that completely covers the head (face, too). Bonus points if you can make the space inside airtight. There are several cameras located outside the helmet (two or more) that broadcast the image in real time either on screens, like in VR glasses, or through lenses directly into the eye, like in Google Glass. Across the surface there are different mounts and rails for various modifications. 

**Possible modifications and functions.**

For example, you could arrange two wide-angle cameras on the sides and thus provide the user a wider field of view than that of a human eye. Theoretically, you could even make a circular 360 degree view (as in you'd see it all at once, not by turning your head), but your eyes and perception would have to get used to it. Surely you could also implement different types of cameras. For example a separate side-mounted module with another camera with powerful optical zoom.

Thermal imagers or night vision devices could be installed, too. This is the most basic functionality. The further the more interesting. In terms of breathing, you could breathe either simply through the valve or through the filters. And if you put a couple of small balloons somewhere on your back that could temporarily provide closed-cycle breathing. Say you dive underwater or the environment becomes very toxic and filters won't work, then you can quickly switch modes and the inlet valve will close.

As for hearing, you could install several different microphones, each optimized for something different, which could significantly improve the capabilities of human hearing. Noise can be suppressed, weak sound can be amplified. Directional microphones could be used for eavesdropping. Own voice can be transmitted both pure or modified. Changes can be both cosmetic, like a different sound, or practical. For example, automatic encryption and decryption on the human side with the correct decryption code. Like, a normal person will hear a set of random sounds or noises, and a person in a helmet - comprehensive speech.

You can think of a whole bunch of other functionality for such helmet. Flashlights, sensors, sonars. No need to mention that everything that happens around can also be recorded. Or something ordinary - Internet access. Also slap the whole set of what modern AR devices can do, like placing markers in real space.

**Controls and fields of use.**

The entirety of this tech could theoretically be controlled by stuff like Neuralink chips where you spend some time getting adjusted to all the inputs/outputs until eventually it feels native, like moving your arm.

I can see military or police benefiting from such devices, though I mostly imagine them being made for personal everyday use. Such a helmet would simply ""improve"" a person, giving them a bunch of functionality with a minimum delay in use. Everything is right there, at your command.

**Summary and possible issues.**

To summarize, I imagine it as a universal device, a platform that is wearable like a helmet and that can perform a wide range of functions, from those that smartphones give us now to highly specialized ones, like something military specific. It's essentially your regular sci-fi helmet, except actually thought through. For some reason I just don't see anyone developing such things. There is stuff like F35 helmet, but that's not quite it.

Some of the drawbacks I see are that in case of personal use, legalization difficulties could arise. Facial recognition systems would become useless. In general a lot of stuff would have to change. Such a device would also likely be expensive as heck. Probably $5-15k without all the advanced modules. It would likely also require a powerful energy source and effective heat dissipation.

What are your thoughts? Do you think such a device could become feasible in the future? Would it even have any use?",Futurology
