Is there some sort of secret short term trading practice that is going around in the Asian community? They tell me they will be back later as they need to analyze the market data and then hours later they show me their profits (some are making $100K easy in a day). They also send me pictures of all their extravagant purchases. 

Are these all scams or something? I feel like these are legit, very wealthy people based on our convos. But they always want to teach me how to do the same as them because they want me to achieve great success with them because they care about ""us""?? Even when I play it off as not interested right now, they eventually come back to the subject and I block them after getting annoyed at the subject. 

I tell them I invest in crypto but long term and they say that is foolish as it's not a sure thing. With short term future trading they say they are a surefire, quick way to generate significant profits.

Overall this article holds a pretty negative bias on cryptocurrency.  I'm definitely not a fan of this, and I don't get the feeling that the writer has much of an idea what they're really writing about.  Note that in my country, this media organisation has a pretty decent reputation for quality journalism (they are government-funded but not government-controlled).  It's disappointing to see this type of reporting.

Worse still is that it was these types of articles about pending doom, extreme volatility, lack of regulation that kept me from investing any sooner than I did.  And, definitely, will be having the same effect on a lot of other retail investors as well.

On one hand this article reports on how risky crypto can be; all the negative things about it but then goes on to mention how our own government may consider it's own stablecoin or how institutions are getting involved.  Surely, if it was as bad as the rest of the article makes it out to be, then wouldn't banks, governments and Wall Street be staying clear of it?  The regular person surely would find this a little confusing.

And yet, nothing of the technology of blockchain.  Nothing of where it's getting adopted and what problems it's solving now, and what utility this technology could provide well into the future.  I just finished watching a video, the gist was that once a country develops into a service based economy, that innovation is required for additional growth.  I think blockchain is the epitome of innovation, and thus, a foundation for future economic growth.  And, this is what creates the value in a project.

I thought we were getting passed the magic internet money perspective, but obviously (at least here) I don't think we are.

My experiences with this have been mixed. On one hand, it’s cool to share your thoughts and speculations with one another. Some predictions and opinions can vary wildly and that’s good.

I've wanted a van for the past decade because I'm an appropriate hoarder and I love to glamp. So much so that I've considered getting into business with a friend to bring curated glamping experiences to festivals as a  supplemental VIP or backstage experience. I got the Jade card when CRO was .16 (as well as a good bit more of CRO) and I had been eyeing a Van that I saw for $10,000. I sold my CRO gains (it hit .71 at this point) and an Ethereum, and then put that money on my Jade card and bought the van straight up. I wasn't even bummed when it climbed up to .91 cuz I had a shit ton staked anyhow and I grabbed a win that brought me great pleasure. And now I have a material asset that will give me genuine pleasure.

We update our KCS to USD price in real-time. KuCoin Token is down 0.33% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #74, with a live market cap of $1,649,858,883 USD. It has a circulating supply of 80,118,638 KCS coins and a max. supply of 170,118,638 KCS coins.

If you would like to know where to buy KuCoin Token, the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in KuCoin Token stock are currently KuCoin, ProBit Global, and AscendEX (Bitmax). You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.

What Is KuCoin Token (KCS)?

KCS is the native token of KuCoin, which was launched back in 2017 as a profit-sharing token that allows traders to draw value from the exchange. It was issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network and was supported by most Ethereum wallets. The total supply of KCS was set at 200 million, and there is a planned buyback and burn until just 100 million KCS remain. Sooner or later, as the KuCoin decentralized trading solution goes live, KCS will be the native asset of KuCoin's decentralized financial services as well as the governance token of the KuCoin community in the future.

KuCoin has also announced that “Empowering KCS'' will be a key priority of KuCoin and will build KCS as a killer product rather than a simple token, which is bound to further diversify the benefits that KCS holders can access. In the long run, KCS performs as the key to the entire KuCoin ecosystem. With the development of DEX and KuChain, KCS will also be the underlying fuel and general token for future KuCoin decentralized products. More details will likely be released in the near future.

What Makes KuCoin Token Unique?

KCS Bonus is regarded as one of the best ways to get passive income. Users who hold more than 6 KCS can get a daily dividend, which comes from 50% of KuCoin's daily trading fee revenue. KCS Bonus is a unique incentive mechanism for KCS holders and KuCoin ecosystem builders. The amount of rewards that users can get depends on the number of KCS held and the trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange.

What Is The KCS Used For?

Besides being paid out as a dividend, KCS, as a utility token, is also used to pay for trading fees on the KuCoin Exchange, allowing users to enjoy discounts of up to 80%. The use case of KCS also includes participation in the token sale on KuCoin Spotlight, as well as LockDrop/BurningDrop on the Pool-X platform. But this is not all, as KCS tokens also serve a series of other purposes on the platform. For instance, KCS holders can become KuCoin VIPs and users no longer need to have a huge BTC trading volume to unlock the reduced maker and taker fees. KCS can also be used as a payment method for shopping, making hotel reservations, buying gaming equipment, and more.

What Is A KCS Burn?

The KCS initial supply was set at 200 million. KuCoin and the KCS team are buying back KCS from the market and burning them every quarter. The amount of KCS to be burned

depends on the quarterly trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange. So the circulating supply of KCS is decreasing and will eventually settle down at 100 million.

How Is the KuCoin Token Network Secured?

KuCoin employs the standard encryption protocol that ensures that user data and data transfers within the system are hidden from other users.

It uses a multi-cluster and multi-layer architectural system that can accommodate more than one transaction at the same time, ensuring system stability throughout every transaction.

In the vast majority of subs I follow, anytime cryptocurrencies are brought up it’s in a negative way. Usually the same misinformation and dumb jokes. “Idling a car to solve sudoku puzzles lol I have one joke and one joke only! And I’m not even original enough to make it!” They say it’s a Ponzi scheme destined to fail, along with the usual fud of “it’s used for crime” and “it’s bad for the environment!”

The one thing I’ve noticed most with these posters though, besides the extreme ignorance, is the extreme CONFIDENCE they have. 

Yet for people so sure of their views that cryptos will tank soon, I have never once seen or heard any of these people say that they will PROFIT from their confidence.

So next time you see this BS, send them a link like this:

https://www.investopedia.com/news/short-bitcoin/

Surely if they’re that smart and confident about this, they will put their money where their mouth is. If I knew with that much certainty that ____ would happen, I would be stupid to not find a way to profit off of it. It would be like going back in time and instead of investing in Apple, investing in Enron. 

If they’re unwilling to do this, it’s for three reasons.

1) they’re too dumb to do this. Hint: don’t take financial advice from dumb people.

2) they don’t have the money to do this. Hint: don’t take financial advice from poor people.

3) there’s a small part of them that thinks that maybe, just maybe, they’re wrong and crypto will go up. And if you’re only investing what you can afford to lose like you’re supposed to, or if you only invest what you get for free from things like Coinbase earn, cointiply, freecash.com, etc then that small hope is all you need. Maybe you lose it. So what? You knew that going in and you didn’t spend what you couldn’t afford to lose. And if that minuscule chance of it getting big happens? Then you made money off of money you didn’t mind losing in the first place. I call that a win/win

Intro:

Aventus network ($AVT) is a true Layer 2 project in which all transactions on the Aventus network (AvN) derive their security from the base layer.
Many projects which people call layer 2s are not actually true layer 2s but more of a side chain in which the security of their transactions are secured mainly by the nodes on their own chain only instead of posting a merkle route of the transaction to a base layer (ZK rollups).

Aventus Network is a layer 2 ahead of its time as not only can it be a scaling solution for Ethereum, a client can chose the base layer in which they want their merkle root of their transactions posted to i.e it can be interoperable with other chains also. Other layer 2s such as polygon (Matic) are not interoperable with other chains. 
Aventus is able to be interoperable with other chains due to being built using Polkadots substrate blockchain. This means that it also has the ability to become a parachain on Polkadot network. 

Funding:

Aventus held a ICO in 2017.
They raised over $20million and still have plenty of runway left.
They are backed by Coinshares who launched the world's first regulated bitcoin investment fund in 2014. Coinshares manage &gt;£5billion in assets.

Enterprise:

Aventus Network is built for enterprises due to predictable transaction costs of ≈$0.01 per transaction and allows clients to be billed in fiat through a fiat using relay partner Coral's (originally know as Artos)
intuitive API and SDKs that take care of all the crypto token payments to the AvN.

This panel from Decipher (a recent conference) is exactly why Algo holders are very excited. If you don't want to watch, TL;DR at the bottom.

The projects we are used to seeing are built by blockchain companies who exist to build blockchain products. A major difference I see here, and thus the reason behind my excitement (The Mucci sees it too), is that these guys are working on bridging existing, traditional companies with DeFi. These companies don't exist because of crypto, but they see a way that Algorand can bring more value to businesses and art collectors/museums. This is the widespread adoption we have been waiting for and that the Algorand team have been working tirelessly for.

As I'm struggling with what to get her anyway, I've decided to get her a small amount as part of a Xmas gift. 

She isn't very tech literate and doesn't have a computer, just an iPhone (unsure of the model except it's getting updates so isn't overly dated). I know little to nothing about the crypto space on iPhones except you don't get Brave browser rewards, which is prompting this post.

So before I even decide what coins to buy (thinking one to demonstrate volatility, the other a solid investment), I'm wondering what the best and most user friendly wallet on iPhone is? Is there anything like Metamask, or any really decent single coin wallets? And if there is any other good apps relating to crypto, feel free to mention so I can install those for her, e.g she's going to need an exchange at some point.

Multi-billion dollar companies without a need to hold ICOs since they're already established should be a good thing for product development right?

Plus they not only have the money for research and development but also for marketing which is a big thing since hype is also a price driver.

Also, there would never be a lack of institutional money because large whales might see confidence in their products because they're already established companies.

Personally I think it would be safer than investing in companies that are just starting out, although there is still much risk associated with it.

We’ve all heard of DCA, but what does it mean? DCA, or Dollar-Cost Averaging, is a way for us as investors to be able to invest money over time into an asset, in this case - cryptocurrency - so that we can get a better rate, or more so “time the market” over a longer period of time. With the volatility of cryptocurrencies, sometimes throwing all of your money at a buy all at once is not the best strategy. Sure there is potential, but not everything is going to 2-50x soon after you buy it. Thus, we have DCA. In this example I am going to use my real-life example of DCA-ing into a coin, albeit in a slightly different way.

I will be breaking down the amounts/prices by week, I’ve kept track of every single transaction and price at the time, etc. I started DCA-ing into -coin- through mining and then found some faucets, and things like that so that’s where a majority of the numbers come from. I have transferred some other small profits into it as well, and have been keeping track of this since November 1st, 2021, so exactly 1.5 months as of today. I am not trying to shill this coin, nor any of the small profits that I will be posting, but I’ve kept close track in trying to give people a real life example.  
Week 1 (11/1-11/6): $-coin- \[439.79\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.032338\] - Total: $14.222

Week 2 (11/7-11/13): $-coin- \[210.952\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.025185\] - Total: $5.313

Week 3 (11/14-11/20): $-coin- \[62.257\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.020847\] - Total: $1.30

Week 4 (11/21-11/27): $-coin- \[130.8177\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.015995\] - Total: $2.092

Week 5 (11/28-12/4): $-coin- \[560.491\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.017998\] - Total: $10.088

Week 6 (12/5-12/11): $-coin- \[1,098.125\] - Avg. Price - \[$0.01854\] - Total: $20.36

As you can see, the average price fluctuates rather greatly, from an average of just over $0.03, to just above $0.015. So, where does DCA come in? If we look at the current price of the coin, versus the price we DCA’d in at, we can see how this strategy of investing *could* be useful.  
I will sort these by the average price that week, versus what that would be at the current time, I will be using a current price of $0.02455 totals are subject to change.

Week 1: $14.222 vs. $10.80 = -$3.422

Week 2: $5.313 vs. $5.179 = -$0.134

Week 3: $1.30 vs. $1.528 = +$0.228

Week 4: $2.092 vs. $3.212 = +$1.12

Week 5: $10.088 vs $13.76 = +$3.62

Week 6: $20.36 vs $26.96 = +$6.60

Let’s again break down these numbers. Using the total buy-in price, I’ve acquired about 2,502.5 -coin- worth - at the time of buying - $53.38, while at the current price (if I were to sell now) I’d have $61.44 (+$8.06). While that’s just over $8.00 in profit, that’s not exactly what we’re trying to show here although it helps prove the point.

Take for example, you don’t spread your purchases out, or DCA, and you blew your whole $53.38 on that first purchase. Your $53.38 purchase at $0.032338 would get you about 1,650.69 -coin-, which would currently be sitting at $40.52, or a net loss of ($12.86)! If you split it into two purchases the first two weeks, you’d have about 1,856 -coin-, or $45.56 and a net loss of ($7.82). Obviously this is where the case of ""*Yeah but if I bought at Week 4 I could easily just double it!*” but the simple truth is that you don’t know what will happen, nobody does. Sure you could get in at the right time, and plenty of people do, but that’s not always the case and should not be something that you rely on.  
I know a lot of this information you’ve already read, or at least heard about, I simply tried to break that down and give a visual example of what that looks like with real numbers. If you found this helpful or think there’s something that could be added or changed, please let me know so that I can adjust it accordingly, thank you all and Happy Crypto and this is not financial advice!",CryptoCurrency,DCA Explained Through Example,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rei321/dca_explained_through_example/,True,submission

You all care for Shib and want to make profits right.
When shib first was around, noone knew of it, and once it was found it exploded. People got very very rich.

Now bone was made as a fair start.

There is only 250 million token. That's it. 250 mil.
Next, there currently is only around 30k holder. Remember when shib only had 30k holders. It was unknown. This is bone right now.

Next is utililty. It is not only used as the voting for DAO which is due for release ASAP, but bone will be used to vote for and make proposals for the whole ecosystem. This can and will affect Shib also!

Next is Shibarium. Bone will be used for gas rather then ETH. This is massive! This means all swaping, withdrawals, LP pools, staking etc etc. All on Shibaswap will require Bone.

Furthermore, this is comparable to Sushiswap. This is not only in the native token use, but the charts since creation follow the same path, as well as the feature of the 6 month timelock.

Now not only there wasn't a big selloff, but Sushi then jumped in price. Now if bone gets out, and just matches Sushi's MC at 1.1B, then bone will be worth $195. 

Think of that RN: Bone is $1.50

If all Shib holders just buy $100 worth then once Shibarium and DAO are both out and fully functioning, your $100 will then be worth $13,000 once thst MC is hit.

Let that sink in

$100 now &gt; $13,000 in 12-24 months.

I find most popular NFTs overhyped and overpriced, but I do think the technology is interesting and worth noting once the market cools down.

\--

After arguing with normal people about the use for NFTs, I now wholeheartedly believe we're just built different. It's like the normal person's brain is not physically capable of understanding the concept. It's not that they're dumb or anything, but they just... **can't!**

It's really fascinating to see, because you'll explain everything every step of the way, they'll agree with you, but they'll **STILL** find a way to completely miss the point.

I don't really care about investing in NFTs since it's way too overhyped and not worth getting into unless you're already a famous person. But even if i'm not willing to put money in, I can SEE and UNDERSTAND why it has potential.

And this ties in to the overall crypto market: your parents, your friends, your colleagues, they're not ""dumb"" for not understanding why cryptos provide utility, their brain is just not capable of conceptualizing a decentralized digital currency and why it has value.

So since most people don't even have the ability to understand and see utility in a blockchain, how are they supposed to understand F\*CKING NFTS?? Most of you guys still think they're **just** JPEGS lmao. (again lemme remind you, i'm not invested in any NFT project, this is not a shill).

Right now, you’re reading a post I made on reddit. You don’t have a clue if this came from a phone, laptop, maybe even a smart fridge. You don’t know the brand or model of that device, you don’t know what internet service provider I’m with. I don’t know any of this about you either, but despite that, me, you and everyone else reading this can seamlessly interact with each other.

Almost every single person is going to have a different combination of devices, ISPs, etc. because we all have different preferences and needs. For example, Some use apple phones for the ease of use and convenience, some use android for better functionality. What’s important, is that for the most part, everything is interoperable regardless, we can just customise our own situations to make them work best for us.

You’re probably seeing how this will relate to crypto already.

**The future of crypto is multi chain and interoperable**. There will never be one single  smart contract platform to rule them all, because at a fundamental level, developers simply just have different needs. Different projects offer radically different user experiences and advantages, there is room enough for many to coexist and that’s a damn beautiful thing.

For example, SOL operates in a way that proportionally, it cannot reach the superb levels of decentralisation of ETH. Though, ETH operates in a way that it can’t come close to insane scalability of SOL. One doesn’t necessarily have to be superior to the other, **they are simply just different**.

Many people will call SOL, or their favourite chain the **“ETH killer”**, but this is such a bad term. ETH doesn’t need to be “killed” for your chain to succeed with its own user base and competitive advantages.

Being an experimental developer who’s always moving things around isn’t sustainable/effective with ETH, so that type of person might choose SOL. One developer might value the on-chain governance of a project like tezos over the more so centralised decision making of ETH. The possibilities are endless.

None of this means ETH won’t continue to thrive, it absolutely will, it just won’t be the only one. If you’re a crypto nerd like me, I know you’ll appreciate how beautiful a fully functioning ecosystem of interoperable blockchains, all with their own unique experience and advantages will be.

So, give up the tribalism and intense competition, and instead embrace overall growth of the crypto environment. Don’t try to FUD and discredit everything that isn’t your favourite chain, instead discuss the differences and advantages. It’s never going to be “only one can win”, so let’s start working and investing with that knowledge.

**TL/DR:** developers and users have fundamentally different preferences and values, one single smart contract platform is never going to service all of those. A beautiful interoperable system of differing blockchains can and will one day be built. ETH does not need to be “killed” for another blockchain to succeed, so give up the tribalism and embrace overall growth!

### Overview

* Crypto Market Insight: 200 EMA | Bitcoin Dominance | Congressional Hearings
* Major Crypto News
* NEWBIES’ Lesson of the Day: What is a non-fungible token (NFT) 

&amp;#x200B;

### Market Insight

Bitcoin continues to test the 48-50k support as volume begins to lose steam. This key support will likely be retested varies times the coming days. The support is in-line with 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which historically indicator of overall market trend. (Above-bull, below-Bear). If Bitcoin holds the 200 EMA, an extended accumulation is likely after a strong ousting of retail positions during the extended drawdown.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Bitcoin Dominance**

It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin Dominance hits new lows or if it decides to break its downward trend. Its generally expected for dominance to rise during uncertain market conditions but that was not the recent case. Investors are becoming more comfortable holding some altcoins like Ethereum during these conditions. Dominance currently sits at 41.49%.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://preview.redd.it/m2ghwy2ahu481.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=737168eff1d33bcb9ae708e079fc9270d66a0e72)

&amp;#x200B;

**Inflation Data**

The U.S. bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI data this morning putting U.S. inflation at 6.8% for the last 12 months. The CPI measures the prices paid by U.S. consumers for goods and services. Inflation is at its highest levels since 1982. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rkqljmqdhu481.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a8586f12ef0d00885e68f3c0ec7222f864186d

 The Federal Reserve that printed 40% of all US dollars into existence this past year is holding talks on December 14 &amp; 15 to discuss bond purchase tapering and interest rate hikes. Crypto investors should keep a close eye on the outcome of the meetings. Widely considered a speculative asset, crypto will be strongly affected by Fed policy changes. Another related factor is the rising number of Covid cases that will likely only get worse as US enters winter. The Fed began aggressive monetary policies around the time lockdowns began in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Congressional Hearings**

     The congressional hearing on Wednesday that featured some keys names in crypto such as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, and Bitfury CEO Brian Brooker were a success according to the participants. Excluding a few Congressmen, there was a sentiment of progress. The CEOs voiced support for a new regulatory platform for cryptocurrency that wouldn’t destroy its progress in the US. Brian Brooks of Bitfury was the MVP of the hearings. [Highlights of the hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6CmsrOFeo).

[Senator Representative Brad Shermon, who appeared to prepare for the wrong type of hearing, added some comedy to the event. Watch minute 2:30.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3o2ATETwBY&amp;t=182s)

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

#### What is an Non Fungible Token (NFT)

*Read in conjunction with yesterday’s*[ *report*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-practical-future-of-nfts-5bfb1cab4e4e)

&amp;#x200B;

Characteristics of NFTs:

* Non-Fungible
* One of a kind
* Cannot be altered
* Will always exist on the blockchain
* Non-Fungible
* A blockchain token

&amp;#x200B;

**Non-Fungible and One of a kind**

Every item on planet on fungible or non-fungible. A loaf of bread is fungible. There are numerous loafs of Wonderbread at the store and It really doesn’t matter which particular one you buy. An example of a non-fungible item is a famous sculpture. The sculpture can be duplicated but it will be never have the value of the original.

**Cannot Be Altered**

When you create an NFT and attach it to the data that mints it on the blockchain, its in a complete state. It will never be altered again. Imagine the Mona Lisa in an indestructible box.

**Will always exist on the blockchain**

Just like bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, once a block of data is minted, it will always exist on a that blockchain.

**A token**

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hamstercoin and NFTs are all tokens. What sets an NFTs apart is that it is ONLY token one of it’s kind. Each Bitcoin is also unique in a sense but the value is identical despite each coin’s uniqueness.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoy your weekend and thanks for reading!

- Staking / earning yield (my favourite so far)
- Using Brave browser
- Watching videos on Odysee
- Earning Karma = moons
- Margin lending
- Mining
- p2p lending
- dividend tokens

Have there been any new ways of earning apart from these ways? (Preferably that pay in Btc or ETH even if it means less income)

When viewing your portfolio balance, it's easy to get consumed by your balance is USD- but it's important to know where you are in terms of BTC and ETH equivalent too.

This is Blockfolio/FTX app, and I use it to keep track of my portfolios. For the purpose of this post, I used a mock portfolio balance to show the main indicators you could look out for. 

The figure below shows the same portfolio but in 3 different balance. USD, BTC, and ETH.

[Mock Balance in USD, BTC, and ETH](https://preview.redd.it/aaupts1bku481.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7365fb22dfb0dc0f6018c576fd81bd64834ae014)

As you can see, you made unrealized 'losses' if you keep it in USD and ETH, however you've made 'unrealized gains' in BTC.

*USD: -5.80%*

*BTC: +0.11%*

*ETH: -4.17%*

&amp;#x200B;

There are many factors influencing this. (1) BTC/ETH's prices; (2) Severity of alts' declines/gains, a few others. But what this shows is that the -5.80% is only applied if you view it from USD's perspective. The end game for some people is to *Stack the Sat* &amp; *Stash a Gwei.*

The figure below is the overview of your portfolio viewed in USD, BTC, and ETH. As you can see, due to ETH's rise over the last few days, your hodls therefore declined in ETH. Due to BTC's decline in price, your hodls therefore increased in BTC.

A rule of thumb to *Stack the Sat* &amp; *Stash a Gwei* is simple. You're in crypto-space. **Therefore, looking at the value through USD is just ONE of your possible exit strategy. If the goal is to stack crypto, then it should be view in terms of Satoshis, or Gweis.**

It’s digital, so it’s incredibly easy to copy, therefore the whole idea that you own this digital item is dumb.

There’s a pretty simple way to reframe this for people to help them understand the ownership aspect and why it’s important. Take a sporting event like an NBA game. All NBA games are streamed online which means you can pretty easily record any game you want and save it to your personal drive. So you essentially “right-click save” an NBA game and you’ve got your identical digital copy now. What can you do with it? Nothing, aside from privately watching it. You have no legal ability to monetize your copy of that game. All you can do is stare at it.

What people aren't grasping is that **it's about ownership**. The copy you save is identical to the copy the NBA has on its servers, but the NBA is the one with **ALL** of the usage rights. If there's a demand for old game footage, they are the ones to capitalize on that digital copy because they own it. Yes, you have the same copy, but you have no rights. NFT’s allow people to prove ownership of a digital item, and the mechanism through which they prove this is immutable and trustless. Things that can be endlessly and easily copied NEED this system. The fact that people think “right-click save” is a valid pushback is actually the very reason why this technology is important. Everyone seems to intuitively understand that they can't copy an NBA game and then host it online and sell a subscription service to watch it. They understand that having a copy doesn't imply ownership and that it would be illegal to try and monetize it. For some reason, people are struggling with this concept in the NFT realm. ***It's about ownership and the rights that grant you.***

TL;DR - If you think you own something simply because you have an identical copy, try monetizing a sporting event or TV show you’ve recorded and see what happens. Yes, you have a copy, but you have no rights. NFT’s provide proof of ownership that gives someone the right to use or monetize something in the same way the NBA is the only one with the rights to monetize the digital copies of their games.",CryptoCurrency,"An easy way to explain NFT’s to people who are stuck on the “right-click, save” problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rdspg3/an_easy_way_to_explain_nfts_to_people_who_are/,True,submission

During the beginning days, I was part of a mining co-op of sorts, we all owned our own machines and hosted at a central place. Some of us had more power than others, but we worked co-operatively to learn and grow.

One of our guys had bought a batch of brand new Antminer L3+ machines from Bitmain. One of them arrived with 3 of 4 hashboards not working. He got lazy, never put in a warranty request, and the box just sat around. He sold me that one super cheap and I figured 126 MH/s to throw at some new shitcoin wasn't a bad idea. So I did a little reading, found a target... and pointed the limping miner at a pool that had that coin on-hand. I started receiving tens of thousands of these coins. This pool paid every 60 minutes, and I was stunned at how fast they flew in. This went on for awhile. When the new Antrouter R3-LTC units came out, I picked up a few to play with. I pointed 2-3 of those at this coin and literally forgot. For years and years, even long after I sold the busted-up L3+, those R3's were continually mining this coin.

I recently discovered that I am now the world's richest holder of this coin. My wallet holds the most of anyone. The next nine holders combined don't equal what I have. 

I'm torn on what it means though... it was never my intention to stack ""the most"" of this particular coin. Honestly, my giant holding is more a product of the fact that very few people were interested in mining this coin, and I mined the longest and the most consistently. 

Some additional facts:  The coin isn't listed on any exchanges that I'm aware of, I'm not sure its on any mining pools any longer... however there are still some active nodes and the coin is not yet ""dead"" in a literal sense.

What do I do? What does it mean? Is this just bragging rights for me? Is there some way to suddenly turn this into a bag of money? Meaningless experiment?",CryptoCurrency,I'm The World's Richest...

Is it now that regulation is on everyone’s mind, people just start piling out of the woodworks?

Is it they realize that this case will effect more than just Ripple and XRP?

Or is XRP gaining traction?

Something to me just feels different, especially now with congress and congress’ mom saying crypto is good.

Quit asking what &lt;insert crypto&gt; is going to, how long it’s gonna take to get there, if it’s crashing etc etc….

Let me be very very clear.


NO BODY KNOWS JACK SHIT!



My best peace of advice that’s not financial advice is as follows…

If you’re scared or nervous just get out. Life is stressful enough as it is and getting worse by the day. No need putting more stress on yourself. 



The dev teams can’t even touch their Coins they get from working on projects for years. Sure it didn’t cost them anything to get it..but can you imagine how many coins over the years have mooned and crashed and burned and the devs couldn’t touch theirs? How much potentially life changing money has come and gone for devs all over the world? 


And lastly you, me, him, or her could drop dead at anytime out of nowhere. The whole damned world could end, there could be a massive solar flare that knocks mankind back to the stone age (That last one sure sounds appealing sometimes) and when/if any of those happen, today’s dip or tomorrow’s moon ride won’t  flipping matter anyway..

Get what you can out of life…we don’t have much time on this rock to begin with anyways…enjoy what you can while you can if you can. 

I hope everyone reaches what ever goal it is you have. And set realistic goals, unrealistic goals of riches wealth and luxury is the first step to failure and it will be your own fault",CryptoCurrency,Quit asking!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rd0pvp/quit_asking/,True,submission

Can't compare to any other high market cap chains.  Or even lesser market cap and member chains.

If this isn’t hype enough for the short term. On that day they have a home game there.

Now looking on down the road-

Like where does the money come from?
I'm talking about all the team, the developers, the marketing team etc etc.

For instances, there are developers that have a wallet containing their crypto, a couple of thousands of something.

Or there are developers that don't have any of it.

With both this options is not conclusive to me how do they get paid, what pays for their monthly wager or yearly wager.

Even if they have thousand of their crypto, they would need to sell to have the money, therefore lowering the price in the process (if it's high amounts), so how do they manage?",CryptoCurrency,How are crypto developers get paid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rd0zzr/how_are_crypto_developers_get_paid/,True,submission

The details have not been made public yet but experts and VC investors along with journalists have come up with some details.
According to the Reuters report, the bill will impose a “general prohibition on all activities by any individual on mining, generating, holding, selling, (or) dealing” in virtual currencies as a “medium of exchange, store of value and a unit of account” — all characteristic of any legal tender. 
Moreover, violating these rules will be treated as a “cognizable” offense, meaning that violators can be arrested without a warrant and held without bail. Other offenses categorized as cognizable crimes in India include murder, kidnapping and dowry death, among others. 
Accoridng to a report by NDTV (One of the leading Indian News channels) the bill proposes fine upto $2.65million and jail time upto 1.5 years. Thats a massive amount given that average Indian makes less then 1000$ per annum.
The crypto bill will regulate crypto exchanges but will outlaw crypto wallets. So Indians will have to hold all of their crypto assets on Central exchanges. This is the biggest fuckup in the bill as it will make Indians speculative traders and non participants in the broader blockchain ecosystem like DeFi , gaming , swapping , liquidity farming and future innovations that are to come!
If no payments are allowed at all and an exception is not made for transaction fee then it will also effectively stop blockchain development and NFT.

Someone commented on a crypto sob story “when investing in crypto, always be ready to lose everything you put in” and that was a very real and realistic comment. Always out yourself in the worst scenario. Losing money is one thing.

Crypto can be very profitable in the long term if you know what to invest in. Things like Futures trading will leave you broke.

Try something like staking from DeFi platforms like ALGO and Yearn and get some governance tokens as well to be able to vote for decisions. Some DAOs like BitDAO have very powerful governance tokens since they’re backed by the biggest treasury in all of the crypto space.

If you have experienced that, what happened? Were you able to get your funds out of Kraken? Did you not see the email until after 72 hours? For example, did you go camping and received the email during the time you were cut off from Internet?

Has anyone ever figured out what can cause this 72 hours before account is closed? I read from many people who posted their stories that Kraken doesn't reveal why for security reasons, so they initially had no idea what it could be. But did anyone figure it out? For example, if you change your phone number or get a new Internet Service Provider, would Kraken suspect your account of having been hacked and give you this 72 hours notice?

The only reason why I'm on Kraken is for DOT staking, so I don't do much trading on Kraken.

Fast forward another week. I realized that I was missing valuable data when I go to sleep. I looked up and practiced unihemispheric slow-wave sleep to allow half of my brain to rest while the other half stayed active. This significantly boosted my gains.

Ubisoft (a major game publisher) is taking a step into the NFT market and linking it to their games. They are calling it Ubisoft Quartz. You can check out the site here [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/)

The first game (test) that they are using is Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon® Breakpoint (released in 2019 and sells for $60 now). This in general isn't a super popular game and basically there is a rumor on Ubisoft ditching Ghost Recon or finding ways to spend less money and time on it. So basically, they are seeing if NFT will bring in extra sells where is needed as a test. Otherwise they could easily get rid of everything if needed.

Because it is only open to 1 game right now, this is the requirements [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits)

(The NFT they are calling Digits)

# Free

Assuming you meet the requirements you can get 3 free NFT (some gun, helmet, and pants)

In the game you will be able to use the items

and sell them

And you can use them on your wallet. Remember not your keys not your crypto. I don't have this game, but am looking at picking it up to see where this goes. But I do wonder if it works with hardware wallets like Ledger.

# The nasty

* We don't know if they are going to kill this off after. Keep in mind, this is more than less a test. But lets assume this will pass whatever test and keep going to other games
* In theory you can use another NFT market as long as it takes Tezos NFT. But we don't know of any downside to this if there is even a Tezos NFT market out there. So you really could be stuck on their platform to sell your NFT if you want.
* Chances are is you will never make any money on an NFT outside if it's super rare and people for whatever really want it. At best instead of losing $10 on an NFT you never will use again, you just like $3 type of thing because the sell made up the difference.
* Since the sell is on the blockchain, you seriously need to check your tax laws in your area.
* There is no word at all if and when NFT will be used in a new games or have any other ability. Meaning when the game dies, so does any use for the NFT could die. This is assuming you can't use it in other games.
* There is no word on if it is possible for the NFT to work with games outside of Ubisoft. Like in theory it should work if a game allows it. But legally, will Ubisoft allow it. More than less the other game will be just reading some NFT which most likely a few lines of code. This telling the game to load whatever thing. And this means in the game itself the thing that represents the NFT has to be animated. Meaning any 3rd party game might run into legal problems with artwork or other things.
* If you can't transfer it to games outside of Ubisoft, then there is a high high high likely that it being on the blockchain is pointless outside of the cool factor and maybe easy to sell. But outside of that, it's basically could just as well be some items attached to your account on their servers.
* There isn't any word if this will be just more micro-transaction type of thing or a play to earn thing. Like will the only way to get NFT is by paying for them/getting them as gifts from other players, or will you be able to also earn some by doing stuff in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

Ubisoft is test driving their new NFT thing. But you need to have Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon® Breakpoint, and meet a few other requirements to get a few free NFT. We could see this expand to other games, but there is no word on that yet. You can put the NFT on your own wallet, and you can sell the NFT. There is no word if they will regularly do a play to earn or if this is another money grab.

&amp;#x200B;

# My opinion

I honestly think it is interesting and hope it does become popular. Not so much for Ubisoft to have a money grab. But this can skyrocket the chances of things we been talking about with the metaverse. Where you will be able to transfer stuff between games, publishers, and other things. Like in RL if AR glasses were popular and the tech was there. I could see a floating thing in my room of the gear I got as an NFT from games I earned with it. Or if some indie game wanted to, they could let us transfer stuff from other games to it.

Now with that being said. Realistically I don't see this going far due to the culture around these big gaming companies. That and how it is tied only to 1 random game that already has been out for 2 years. And because of this, I don't think anyone should be going into this thinking they will make a ton or any money from this. Like you might here xyz streamer making a ton. But it's the same problem that is in the NFT market now. Where you have people buying it due to the person who is selling it and not due to the product. And chances are is if you just stop being tomorrow. Outside of family, friends, and a handful of others. No one would generally care or noticed. Meaning you shouldn't ever compare a famous person's success to you.",CryptoCurrency,Something to know when dealing with Ubisoft Quartz NFT,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rcajfm/something_to_know_when_dealing_with_ubisoft/,True,submission

Back for a quick guide on how to do your own research :

**coinmarketcap/coingecko**

First  thing I do is Coinmarketcap or coingecko . if the coin have mooned  several thousand percent and crashed at any point in time it’s usually a  big red flag for me .

The king of that metric would be BTC/ETH constant gain over the longest term

**Coin or Token**

token are easily minted so I give them extra screening especially bsc ones

**Website/whitepaper**

Proceed  to take a quick look at their website and white paper most serious  project have a well-made video or presentation to explain their utility  and problem there are solving

**Development**

Then I head to GitHub this is a MAJOR one for me. I look at the activity commits/code frequency/contributor

If this metric is low it’s a MAJOR redflag for me there is a few exception like project that do not rely on heavy dev

The kings of that metric would be ETH/cardana/polkadot/solana

**Use**

Blockchain  explorer and on-chain metric going to be your friend here if very  little uses the project or adoption is not going upward and marketcap is  already high this is a HUGE red flag , I use most of the project I’m  invested into on weekly or daily basis (defi,transfer,ects…)

osmosis,rayduim,tinyman,traderjoe ... i use them all

Why would you gamble/invest in a project you don’t even use/like yourself?!

The king of this metric is Solana with 66M transaction daily

**TRY IT**

that would be my last step throw in a few $$ and try it see if you like it . UI good ? fees? speed ?

**Conclusion**

Now  you have to compare what is comparable. Cannot compare on-chain metric  of a micro-cap with Solana that would be silly, if the project you are  looking into is well above in every metric comparable to project within  the same MCAP you most likely found a long term winner.

Tokens which seemingly do not have inherent value or a specific use case, or serious ambition at all. The most notable example of this would be Dogecoin. A coin seemingly created as a joke, but rising sharply in value. But why is that? 

Note that this is my personal opinion and interpretation. I’m not stating this as a truth. I’m curious what your opinions are about this subject. 

Now there are people claiming that one coin holds inherent value, more so than others. A Bitcoin may have more value than a Monero. A Litecoin should have more value than a Dogecoin, right? But I think in this particular reasoning, something is missing. The value of a currency is basically nothing but the social acceptance of its value. A Bitcoin may be worth $25.000 because we deem it so. A Dogecoin may be worth $1 because we think people will buy it for that. Of course we know tokens which are backed by a product. A good example is Ethereum or BAT. They have working products, with the token as some kind of incentive / market currency within. These edge along the regions of assets / securities with their own playground. 

A euro isn’t ‘better’ than a dollar. Nor is a yen inferior to Kenyan shillings. Said currency gains traction (long ago) in the market as the accepted form of value transfer. The exact ‘value’ reaches a certain equilibrium in regular circumstances. There are plenty of currency instabilities to mention here, even in the fiat world. But know that central banks have the task of regulating the monetary market, by manipulating supply and demand to keep price volatilities at bay.

So, what do you think about this? Does every token need a ‘product’ or ‘solution’ to a problem? Or is being a socially accepted currency enough?",CryptoCurrency,Memecoins and overall value - I think memecoins have worth,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rcb91r/memecoins_and_overall_value_i_think_memecoins/,True,submission

Alright, month two of tracking how much airdrop freebie crypto I am making a month. For a reference now, since Brave is an absolute pain in the ass browser that'll only pay you if and when it feels like, I'm only including the BAT that makes it to my Gemini wallet. Also, I failed to really count last month so I went back and updated those two parts.

Here's a link to last month's post if you're at all interested

[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qp767b/ive\_made\_beer\_and\_smoke\_money\_through\_the\_free/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qp767b/ive_made_beer_and_smoke_money_through_the_free/)

# Last month's value in USD at prices for that time. 77.16$

I've spent way too long getting my shit together to make sure I have everything accounted for now. So this point moving forward should be completely accurate for each month. Although, when I can throw the BAT from mobile into my Gemini, that'll give a weird surge, it is what is.

&amp;#x200B;

|Crypto Earned|Amount last month|Value today $|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bat|1.25|1.64|
|Pre|74.49|23.58420441|
|Moons|315|38.4111|
|Donuts|6717|45.621864|
|Lbry|7.65|.384|
|Hi Dollar|27|33.75|
|Cointiply|20725|2.0725 USD worth in BTC|
|Hive|1.443|1.70274|
|Hive Dollar|1.408|2.59072|
|Actifit Tokens|140.522|1.632092769|
|ROY|38.69|0.3255125115|
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
||Total|151.7147|

So, that is almost double the USD value of last month. It is nice to think that we are still in a bit of a slump as well. If this all just starts mooning out this coming month (Like Hive hitting 3 dollars) that'll be wicked.

# Is all this worth it?

PRE is getting to be more of a pain in the ass now. I have no idea if I will actually be able to withdraw any of it when I accumulate 1000. They keep messing with the amount you receive per search. It went from .1 to .085 to .075 to .06 then came back up to .0736. Then half the time I need to refresh each search instance or it doesn't register.

I'm surprised that cointiply is still putting out as much as the first month, roughly. I expected it to be like Odyssey, give you a bunch day one, and then you're getting a penny a day. Hive, Hive Dollar, and Actifit tokens? Yeah, sure why not. It basically takes zero effort to get the actifit, because I walk about 4,000 steps a day already to get to work.

The Donuts are insane though, I never thought my Reddit account would have tangible value and here we are. Through just posting up some articles I read and interacting with the community.

Overall, this is pretty motivating especially with the exclusive of 90% percent of my BAT and the downward turn prices overall took last weekend. Maybe I could be striking over 200 USD if the prices are good. At today's prices, it is about 5 dollars a day and I put maybe an hour of time into it max while I'm having breakfast or at work. So, it is worth the time investment imo.

We the people have never needed out-of-touch, self-serving, and self-absorbed billionaires guiding our beliefs or telling us what to think, what to do, and what to believe. It's a disservice to worship, idolize, or follow these rich strangers when there have been countless regular people who have poured time, money, and their lives into developing solutions through crypto technology and adoption.

Do not follow someone who would be disgusted to breathe the same air as you. Follow someone who wants to make the world better for themselves and the people around them. They are not heroes and humbly shouldn't think themselves to be one. They are you and they are me.

I won't bother going into the definitions but you can do some reading on [LPs](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi) and [IL](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

While yes, in the world of Crypto coins are shooting to new heights all the time, I feel that worries over impermanent loss is a bit overblown.  Given the high APRs and APYs provided when you lend to LPs, most of the risk of IL is mitigated.  Let's take a look at an example using this [impermanent loss calculator](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/):

Let's say you are staking liquidity in a lower risk randocoin-stablecoin pair

Coin A starts at: $10 and of course coin B is at: $1.  Eventually Coin A reaches $50 while Coin B stayed at $1.  Plugging these values into the calculator gives us an impermanent loss: 25.46%.  While you may be thinking OMG I LOST 25.46% OF MY INVESTMENT, it took Coin A increasing by a whopping 500% before you suffer a loss of 25.46% when you sell your investment.  OFC in the crazy world of crypto a 500% gain is just child's play as well, but when we know the risks we can make more informed decisions.  

Another thing to note is that if both coins rise by roughly the same %, the impermanent loss suffered is extremely minimal, so if you stake your liquidity in two coins you expect to grow at the same rate, again, impermanent loss should not be a huge worry.

Hopefully this knowledge has helped to remove a bit of fear when it comes impermanent loss and helps some of you develop strategies going forward!  As with all investing, LP staking has it's inherent risks and isn't just free passive income.

It is only available as a reward for activity and cannot be bought or sold for fiat or crypto. Its main functions are facilitating a metagame economy, cycling profits from merch sales back into the community, and rewarding general activity through redeemable prizes.

With that said, and with all the talk on this subreddit about crypto games and how they are pretty universally bad in one aspect or another, I thought I'd outline one example of cryptocurrency technology being used independent of a profit motive to provide a better experience for gamers.

I'm also hopeful it will provide inspiration for other people looking to use crypto for their gaming communities. I posted about it once before, but it's now a proven concept. Finally I should disclose that I came up with the idea (with plenty of input from my people to help), so it's possible I could be biased.

------

&gt;#Summary

[HubCoin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRnnKygx0X4_t22yGjykIxjl0mFFTepTRkEsmPmxeTY/edit?usp=sharing) is an ERC-20 (Goerli Testnet) cryptocurrency distinct from other existing gaming cryptocurrencies in a few major ways.

HubCoin is the native currency of the [Galactic Hub](https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Galactic_Hub_Project) multiplayer group (conventionally referred to as a ""civilization"" for years even before all the new metaverse talk) in the game [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/). This is meta content stacked on top of meta content - No Man's Sky is not made to facilitate any cryptocurrency, and even the support for our multiplayer group is very limited (although the developers did add our logo to the game as a decal!) This immediately distinguishes it from other currencies which are built on top of games designed, as one of the two ""Crypto gaming sucks"" posts pointed out, around the premise of blockchain integration first and actual gameplay &amp; fun second. It's even distinct from anything I was personally able to find on Minecraft servers, which sometimes integrate BTC or ETH, but (as far as I saw) do not have their own native currencies.

HubCoin is earned exclusively through activity in the Galactic Hub civilization. It can thus be considered a tokenized unit of player activity, which is ultimately the only resource that matters in any multiplayer video game. Likely the biggest distinctions between HubCoin and other gaming cryptos, and indeed the reason many people on this subreddit may not be especially interested, is that HubCoin is never available for purchase. Being caught selling it will result in your address being blacklisted and your accounts being banned from Galactic Hub platforms. This is currently the only rule of HubCoin usage. This is done for a few reasons,

* Avoid semi-monetization of a game which is not only not monetized, but provided years of free updates

* Minimize legal headaches, both for myself and maybe for the developers

* Minimize any incentive for scams or fraud involving HubCoin

* Prevent any barrier to entry or ""buy in cost"" as seen (from my understanding) with games like Axie Infinity

* Allows it to be based on Goerli Testnet, resulting in $0 transaction fees and minimizing potential energy consumption

Currently, 34% of our 124 registered citizens have signed up for HubCoin usage. Although this rate could clearly be improved, I'm happy with it for now, considering we've had a steady stream of new sign-ups, multiple new players expressing immediate interest in it after joining, only had it available for about 1 month, and considering the slight intimidation people unfamiliar with crypto feel when setting up their first wallet.

[206 transactions](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0xaaeddee8a8112ffdb798a02ca19a732e1434b6e6) have been processed in the first ~1 month of HubCoin use. Although many of those earlier transactions were from Hub staff, more recent transactions are to and from a variety of addresses in a variety of amounts, showing actual economic interactions.

------

&gt;#Incentives for Use &amp; Accumulation. &amp; Examples of Use

So if it can't be sold for real-world money, you may be rightfully wondering where the incentive to actually use and earn the currency is. Part of the appeal is simply the fun and added depth of having a metagame economy. As a long-time figure of the NMS multiplayer community, I've tried to create a metagame economy many times in the past. Every attempt failed. I feel this is because there are no resources in the game which are scarce, transferable, and unable to be gained through 'cheats' like glitches to duplicate items. HubCoin solves every single one of these issues, and it's seen considerable success as the cornerstone of a metagame economy. 

Still, if there are no resources in the game which are particularly difficult to obtain, what incentive (beyond convenience) exists to accumulate HubCoin? So far, this has three main answers -

* **Leadership-Granted Rewards**

A number of rewards are redeemable from Galactic Hub staff using HubCoin. Currently, the majority of these are digital rewards. Some are very noteworthy, like the ability to the name &amp; theme of a new planetary colony, or exclusive eggs from extinct, historically-significant Hub fauna which were made ""de-extinct"" through [a special Jurassic Park-style initiative](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Jurassic_Hub_Project), Others are more basic, like special flairs on our subreddit. 

Physical prizes are also scheduled to be available in early 2022. But if HubCoin is never sold, you may be asking how we raise funds to produce physical goods. As someone who has run this group for 5+ years but never tried to make a dollar off of it, this is one of my favorite parts of HubCoin. We will fund physical prizes for HubCoin through our standard merch sales. While our merch was previously set at a 0% profit margin, we've now raised that to generate a bit of profit. All profits and costs are recorded publicly. After any operation costs (ie activity tracking bot for our Discord) are paid for, profits are used to basically buy back our own merch at cost. They are then provided as HubCoin prizes - enabling us to provide physical prizes for the community, paid for by the community, without ever requiring them to purchase any crypto. Of course, this likely generates a limited amount of funds compared to actually selling the currency, but I feel it's the better choice for my community in the big picture. 

So far no prizes have been claimed, which may suggest either a lack of interest in the prizes or, more likely imo, a desire to save their HubCoin up until they can redeem the higher-tier rewards.

* **Exclusive Player-Generated Rewards**

Similarly, some players have started offering exclusive rewards of their own. This has primarily taken the form of companion eggs as well - for example, one player runs a business selling eggs for Birds, which cannot normally be obtained (weird game, I know, everything lays eggs except birds). Another player sells custom mega-sized companion eggs, scaled beyond the limits of what the game could normally allow. Both of these require a fair amount of effort on the part of the ""business owner."" While this content was already accessible to any adequately-savvy PC player, and maybe a few of their friends if they were feeling generous, HubCoin has created an incentive for our players to provide this service to anyone with some coin, including console players due to crossplay.

* **The Arts**

One of the least expected results is an increased interest in ByteBeat - No Man's Sky's in-game music composition 'software'. I personally hired a few ByteBeat composers to provide a reggae-inspired soundtrack for my field of space-weed and I'm very happy with the result. 

--------

&gt;#The Future

As for where HubCoin is going from here, that's largely up to the players and what content the developers Hello Games choose to add. I do have some initiatives planned for the immediate future -

* **Expanding on the Arts**

I'm leaning into this new community interest in ByteBeat by launching a number of ""state-sponsored"" campaigns to provide HubCoin to ByteBeat composers. I'll provide an mp3 download link, and tracks can also be downloaded to an in-game ByteBeat library and re-uploaded at other bases. Anyone who uses either type of download will be requested, although not required, to give a HubCoin donation to the artist who composed it.

* **Sports &amp; Betting** 

We're getting ready to re-launch a [multiplayer competitive sports organization](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Star_League). Our goal is to bring consistent competitive multiplayer content to a game which has no competitive matchmaking of any kind (no deathmatches, racing lobbies, etc). Based on community feedback, we're starting with a focus on PVP infantry combat, but will be expanding to starship combat (aka dogfights), exocraft racing (space cars), and minigames (Skee Ball, Pachinko, companion / animal races, etc).

HubCoin will be involved in two ways: first, some events will have entry fees. All entry fees will be placed into a prize pool and divided in a staggered fashion either among the top 3 winners, or granted entirely to the 1st place winner, depending on the type of event. In many cases this prize pool will either be contributed to or matched by the Galactic Hub's main fund (""Treasury"") as a prize. Second, spectators will be able to place bets on the winners of events, again with the types of bets varying by the type of event. 

* **Governance**

This is something I've only begun to look into. Although my civilization is not a democracy, I do want it to operate in the best interests of its citizens. Depending on future conditions, I'd like to at least have the option of governance built in. Depends on the degree of complexity though, my coding skills are limited - perhaps someone interested enough to have read this far could help me with this.

------------

Besides that, although it's outside of my control, I'd like to see the other large civilizations in No Man's Sky establish their own currencies. Provided they also couldn't be exchanged for real-world money, you would be permitted to exchange HubCoin for other No Man's Sky-based currencies.  Or one of you could start your own civilization, with its own currency, and start recruiting. It's a huge galaxy and a great sandbox.

So, there you go. HubCoin: far more thought-out than your average shitcoin, but guaranteed to eternally be worth $0, by design, for the community. A weird and strange and, I like to think, pretty excellent example of crypto in gaming.

You’ll see drastic shifts regardless of if we’re in a bull or bear, which can trick you to think we’re out of that cycle. We’ve only been on a slight decline about a month, but still sitting much higher than we were 6 months ago. It’s not clear if we’re just stabilizing right now.

My point is this, HODL! You don’t have to sit on your coins the whole time to HODL. In fact you can stay in the same coins you support by selling when they’re at a nice high. Then you HODL those profits in fiat or stablecoin and when we see a decline like this, buy more of the coins you like. Then HODL!

There are many people who like to HODL and not buy/sell during ups and downs. That technique is just as fine but may not produce as much profit.

Many of us here make predictions but nobody can say with certainty if we’re entering a bear. If we are, it will go much lower. To the point where you will question your life choices and you’ll see people make desperate decisions. This is also where HODL comes in handy.

HODL in a bear market and accumulate more if you’re fortunate enough to be able to and you will see great profit. Understand this can take years, but as adoption is accelerating, maybe not that long.

I am here to point out why I believe everything i didn't buy that rose in price is the worst buttchain of all chainlinkers, and those who know their shit are a great disservice to my mother. I'll start with a kicker....

I KNOW HOW TO **SPELL WORDS.** (Mostly, words that i made up).

As an old-school developer of the **original** HELLO WORLD programs, written on scratch, I am a **FINANCIAL GENIUS.** Forgetting to say hello to Elon Musk on MARS is against EVERYTHING apes stand for. A CLOSED-OPEN SOURCE HELLO MARS??? Those are two adjectives, plus a noun, IN ENGLISH. As a side note: **FUCKING MAGNETS: HOW DO THEY WORK???**

NATOSHI SAKAMOTO IS **AN APE.**

If it walks like an ape, and talks like an ape, it's clearly a banana. The entire point of apes are to eat bananas. Why not an apple? DEAD SRS RIGHT NAO. If you have a master ape who says hello to the world. YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE HE'S REALLY AN ANONAPE. Also, i hold no bananas.

**CRAIG WRIGHT IS TELLING THE TRUTH.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the above un-refuted, unemotional analysis, i demonstrated that WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND **FUCKING MAGNETS.**

Their team has been hard at work getting all of their Smart Contract code (currently running on Kusama) ready to launch. They're in the process of conducting auctions rn and will launch the first 5 parachains on **December 18th**! That means real, live smart contracts running on the DOT network... finally!

To commemorate this momentous occasion, I thought I'd share some facts I've compiled on DOT!

Some interesting DOT facts:

* Founded by Gavin Wood. Gavin was the co-founder of Ethereum alongside Vitalik. He invented the Solidity programming language which powers all of Ethereum.
* More active developers on it than every blockchain except Ethereum. It has 75% more active developers than Ethereum did when they were the same age. There are 400% more active developers on Polkadot than Cardano. See this report by Electrical Capital Group: [**https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444**](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444) Slide 99 if you just want to skim.
* Has a real money, beta-testing blockchain called Kusama. You have a strong guarantee that any parachain of DOT will have been battletested against strongly incentivized adversaries. 
* Has some crazy tech like the ability to self-upgrade without needing to hard fork. For example, DOT changed its base denomination without needing to fork. Contrast this with the process of converting LEND to AAVE - that was a hard fork requiring users manually submit transactions or be left behind. Expect more upgrades that are impossible for most protocols to do without forking. [**https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-launch#core-functionality**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-launch#core-functionality)
* Polkadot's equivalent of ICOs, Parachain Lease Offerings, are starting to roll out. You loan money instead of buying outright. You get alt coin tokens immediately and your DOT back \~months later.
* The DOT ecosystem is 50 billion, [**https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/dot-ecosystem**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/dot-ecosystem). There is no ADA Ecosystem tag on CoinGecko. :) 
* There are some very serious projects launching via the PLO system within the next month. **Moonbeam**, [https://moonbeam.network/](https://moonbeam.network/), and **Acala**, [https://acala.network/](https://acala.network/). These projects have already launched sister tokens against Kusama. **Moonbeam** is a bridge to Ethereum. **Acala** is the leading stable coin for the DOT ecosystem.
* [**https://playground.substrate.dev/**](https://playground.substrate.dev/) allows engineers to get started building in-browser. This level of developer support is peerless in the crypto ecosystem.

I went all in on a crypto (please no judgements haha) and my initial investment of about 4K climbed to 20k. For many reasons I don’t need to go into, I sold… and then bought back in almost immediately. Stupid, I know. I’ve held since then and my portfolio is now around 10k. 

Because I sold at about a 16k profit, I’m assuming I’ll need to pay taxes on that gain… even though I don’t have all that money anymore.

Would it be bad for me to sell…again, right now so that the IRS (or whoever looks at this kinda stuff) will see that I’m only up 6k instead of 16k? 

Thanks for any help in advance!

Have I made money? Yes, but! Today I decided to pull out of the market. 

So many coins I have made money from, have absolutely zero use, and I can't understand why price fluctuations happen to certain things but not others. Like some guy makes a tweet, then the next day an utterly useless coin has gone up exponentially. 

Someone buys a stadium name then its price skyrockets, I know the argument can be made that exposure is advertising, and that makes it seem like a business with solid foundation, but honestly, it seems really wierd to me from an investment standpoint. As if I'm not waiting for my coin to become useful, I'm waiting for it to get some clout to cash out.

Along with that is the difficulties that come with it, have I bought stuff with crypto? Yeah, I'd rather use fiat, because, y'know, everywhere uses that as a recognised currency. My bank doesn't try to charge me a $30 fee to transfer $100 to my other bank account. I don't have to worry my money will be lost forever if I put one wrong digit it. (I understand some countries benefit from having defi) 

I have nothing against crypto, and am stoked for everyone that's been able to make extra money, or even set themselves up for life on it! But the time I have put in trying to learn how it works, what I should do with it, and most importantly when to buy and sell, could have been spent just doing a few extra shifts at work to make three times as much. 

I always ask why? When I don't understand something. I've found with crypto, nobody can answer any whys effectively, or dumb it down enough so I'm able to understand. I just feel like people throw in buzz words about the fundamentals of coins/how it's awesome, but not answer the question, why? How? 

I don't really know what this post is for, I guess I was getting tired of so many people hyping up this thing that CAN make them alot of money, just like the casino can. I. Just. Don't. Get. It. 

I will say for anyone looking at getting into crypto, try digging for some negatives on the subject rather than looking at it through rose tinted glasses, then weigh up if it's the right investment for you, because I found a lot of hidden speed bumps along the journey.",CryptoCurrency,Do y'all really know what you're investing in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rarqwo/do_yall_really_know_what_youre_investing_in/,True,submission

This includes the supply and the “rich list” of a particular cryptocurrency.  

Utility - Does this cryptocurrency or token have a unique utility in the real world?  Examples would include Holochain, IOTA or BAT.  I’m not even saying those are good investments, I am just strictly referring to them having unique utility.  

Adoption - Do you see this cryptocurrency as having at least a decent chance at adoption in society, specifically does it have a reason for society to want to adopt it?

Funding - Does your cryptocurrency have a large amount of funding?  Example - CRO, Solana


Tech - Does your cryptocurrency have powerful technology, such as high TPS speeds or A.I powered technology? Example - Solana (high TPS) and The Graph (powerful A.I. indexing)

Lately a lot of attention has been given to crypto.com that has been flexing its insanely large marketing budget, and for a few years prior to this, Binance has been mainly in the spotlight.

For me I still am leaning towards moving all of my active trading to DEXs, but I am still curious about how people feel about Coinbase, the coins they list, their fees, staking, earn programs (I’ve never received my xlm btw after watching all the videos), their pro version, etc. 

This is because crypto still needs on and off ramps, deposit and withdrawals. Binance has become. Increasingly hard in Europe with the SEPA boycott and I’m leaning towards on/off ramping on upbit, coinone, bithumb or korbit for Korean won availability.

No, thats the obvious answer.

Build Generation Wealth. If you understand how early we are in this space, and the potential for growth, you will ignore what the media and doubters say about Bitcoin and Crypto in general. I understand 99% of crypto with die in a bear market but the fact is Crypto now is different than crypto compare to the last 10 years. I believe the top 5 meta coins along with the few top 10 cryptos not including Shiba/doge will survive. Eh, maybe Shiba/doge will survive because memes are cool so who knows.

Going back on us underestimating growth potential. The perfect example is how BTC was literally viewed as worthless and to some is still is, nobody expected it to hit 10k let alone 20k,40k, and even 69k. 

The Money supply in derivatives, stocks, bonds, gold, fiat, etc. far exceeds 1 trillion and without a doubt, I can see BTC becoming the new standard as it can't be created and there will only be 21million with around 3million being lost and more to be with people forgetting their wallet phrase or losing it. Blockchain technology must replace the current system of money because if we were to ever hit space and colonize it, there is no way u are waiting months to years in sending money. This may not happen within our life time, but it might be within our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. And if you guys are young and plan on not having kids, then I guess it cant apply to you.

The reason most of us avoid FOMO is also emotional, unfortunately. That's why sometimes we evade the feeling, but even though we know it might be detrimental to our financial state, some other times we give in.

What we use is commonly known as a ""logical fallacy"". An example would be ""everytime there are black clouds in the sky, something bad happens in my life"". If we think logically, we would realize there's zero relation between the weather and a random individual's daily life.

Same thing goes for crypto and investing: ""everytime I give in to FOMO and buy some, suddenly it all goes red"".

Oh yeah? But guess what, that wasn't the case with Cardano, Solana, and Terra for most of the time. You lost your chance to make some life changing money, let's face it.

But guess what? Most of us ***still shouldn't give in to FOMO***, but only with logical reasons backed up with scientific facts and historical data, so that we can have a firm opinion and decision on this.

FOMO in crypto is a huge risk, because it's often a much more volatile market than stocks and other investments. Also, as the market is still in its infancy, whales can easily manipulate the natural flow of the system.

FOMO is not inherently bad if it teaches you these vital lessons, but it's still not bad even if it influences your decisions in two cases:

The one thing I want for Christmas is for everyone to start getting along in our industry. It's extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and viewpoint, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as people. It's extraordinary.

You don't see this in other industries. You don't see in physics or biology, or cellphone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hate, and vitriol that our industry has for each other. And as long as we're doing that to each other, there's no reality where we're ever going to be able to overcome the real enemy, which is the legacy systems that hold three billion people and the human race down, destroy our environment, and divide us in ways that make us hate people we've never met and should never have grievances against.

That has to stop. And the only way it's going to stop is if we get better systems that are more fair. And the only way we do that, is we have to work together. So, we'll see, 2022 whether that's accomplished. People will still try to divide us. Books will be published. Podcasters will say things. Reddit and Twitter will continue to pour rivers of verbal diarrhea. But it's up to each and every one of us to transcend that, step above it, and realize that we have a finite window.",CryptoCurrency,What Charles Hoskinson wants for Christmas (he won't get it),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rash26/what_charles_hoskinson_wants_for_christmas_he/,True,submission

In the past we’ve definitely had clear bull and bear markets at various times, but when you look at the past year or so things have been far too erratic to call any of it “bull” or “bear” market. A *run* maybe, but not a market. 

Bull markets and bear markets are terms that were created for the stock market, not for crypto. Sure they’ve worked for crypto too so far, but crypto is new and evolving, and the ways it’s markets work are still growing and finding their own patterns. 

We’ve seen crazy new all time highs in the past year or so, but we’ve also crashed dramatically from them. More than once. Maybe we’ve reached the point where crypto has simply become too erratic and too different from the stock market and the patterns we’re all used too for us to keep trying to conceive of it in old ways. 

Maybe we need to stop asking “is this the bear market?” at every dip or crash and stop wondering “how long will this bull market last?” at every peak? Maybe it’s become more nuanced than that, and we need to start accepting that nobody knows shit about fuck and anything could happen at any time, *always*.

It’s a new paradigm. A new game. Old patterns don’t necessarily apply any more. Every day in this market is a complete unknown, and any attempt to conceive of the market as a whole according to old and familiar patterns has the potential to lead us astray.

It’s worth repeating: anything could happen at any time. **Seriously.** This could be the start of a long hard multi-year crypto winter, or we could theoretically still hit 100k btc by end of year. (**Highly** unlikely, yeah, but this is crypto. *Anything could happen.* **Nobody knows shit about fuck.** Time to accept that fact, let go of outdated and limiting ways of thinking, and continue to venture boldly and blindly into the unknown.

Lower volume which is a factor that gives crypro whales the edge. They are most likely using data from chains that is more often then not insider information about margin numbers. They can swoop in with their cache of btc and drop that price to the best low resistance possible amd buy up those on margin.  The exchange will liquidate you and the whales just profited millions. Sure crypro trading is 24/7 but not very easy to add huge amounts to your account on short staffing during the weekends and so it's hard for most not to get liquidated.

This past week I just added a bag to the cronos beta which is apart of the Crypto.com defi wallet. Atm you can earn up to 615% on their farming pools and up to 1420% on their mines, but these rates are decreasing very rapidly at the moment due to the amount of money being added to them. 

Another defi that I am partaking it currently is Euphoria which is a DAO on the harmony network. They’re currently giving about 798,000% APY but this will also decrease as time goes on. 

The final Defi project I am in is beefy finance on the cronos network. The BSC network is giving some insane APY’s with %’s in the trillions but I’m a little skeptical of them.

**TL;DR:** Get a stable coin on an appropriate blockchain wallet (e.g., UST on Terra Station), find an appropriate DEX (e.g., via [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes)), and DCA like you would normally on a CEX (centralized exchange, like Coinbase). Account for gas.

**Why am I writing this:** Right before the dip, I purchased a decent sum of SCRT. I wish I instead DCA-ed. Better yet, I wish I DCA-ed on the SCRT blockchain via a DEX of theirs (Secret Swap).

**How to get started:** You need to get a wallet that works for the token you like (e.g., TerraStation for Luna; MetaMask for AVAX or FTM; and in this case Keplr for SCRT). Ideally you are connecting a cold hardware wallet rather than just using the hot wallets themselves.

You then need to get any compatible token onto that wallet. (In some cases this is super simple, like all the available Eth-20 tokens for an Eth wallet. In other cases, this is quite convoluted, as with SCRT if you live in the US). Make sure you transfer some crypto that can go towards gas (e.g., you can't pay for gas on Fantom Network with fUSDT).

You then locate a DEX (decentralized exchange) that you like. [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes) is a useful resource for locating ones on the specific blockchain with high TVL (and whether they've been audited).

You then want to swap on the DEX to a stablecoin that the DEX regularly uses (you should check if they trade primarily through DAI, UST, USDC, or other stables) then bang, you're done. DCA like you would on a CEX (e.g., buy $10 every day, or $20 every other day, or 70 every week).

**Important:** Unlike on CEX's who solely do trading fees, **you will be paying gas fees.** So there comes a point where it is uneconomical to do small purchases, since a larger percentage of your money will solely go to gas (especially on Eth right now).",CryptoCurrency,A crypto noob learns how to DCA on DEX's,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r9zimx/a_crypto_noob_learns_how_to_dca_on_dexs/,True,submission

I want to share my experience with hotbit exchange yesterday such that your comments can give me an insight to what exactly transpired.
I’ve been buying and hodling coins on hotbit for quite sometime now. Everrise(Rise) is one of those coins. In fact, I just invested in Rise recently; I bought up to 1.9 billion Rise coins.
As a routine for me, I log into my hotbit account at most every two days; sometimes every other day. I equally check on the markets at FTX( former Blockfolio), coinmarketcap, coingecko and others.
With the tools above the price per Rise coin has been ranging between 0.00000007 and 0.00000008; and I had about $150.00 on my Rise coin.
Then yesterday when I checked, I was elated to see on FTX that Rise was trading at 0.0011. First I thought I was hallucinating or something; so I clicked on it to see if it changes. To my surprise it remained at 0.0011. I then had to check on coinmarketcap and coingecko only to realise that the new price is real. 
Having confirmed the new price, I hurriedly logged into my hotbit exchange and, to my greatest shock, hotbit has unlisted Rise coin; with no dollar value to my 1.9 billion Rise coins. Even the money I invested vanished just like that. There is not even an option for me to withdraw the asset.
It’s not the first time hotbit unlisted a coin I invested in. The first was with Dogo. I didn’t actually bother about that because when I checked in other platforms, the Dogo coin no longer existed. However, this one is absolutely different, in my opinion, because Rose still exists and is trading in some other exchange. 
How come a coin which appreciated so much in value is instantly unlisted on hotbit exchange? Is there something I am missing here? What exactly happened here?
I just hope it’s none of the possibilities I’m thinking about.
I hereby solicit for your inputs so that I can have a proper understanding of what actually transpired here, as well as an idea of the way forward from here.
Should it, by chance, be that I actually made  so much money (do the math) on my asset, I want ideas on how to recover the money from hotbit exchange. On the other hand, if actually there’s no foul play here, don’t we the clients deserve some explanation as to what actually took place?
With issues like this emanating from the crypto business/investments, it has become pertinent that there should be some sort of control; at least for accountability. It cannot be that investors just lose their assets with practically no one to talk to, nor any form of explanation from any quarters. It does not necessarily have to be government control.
This global control of crypto operations should actually challenge crypto currency developers to think of creating an altcoin that provides this unique solution; please bring me on board when you take this advice, and actually work on developing such coin.
This is important especially as ‘no control’ may spell ‘no future,’ in my opinion.
Kindly give your inputs regarding this issue of the unlisting of Rise on hotbit exchange following a massive gain in value.
Thank you.

The following crypto tactics may get you thro’ the space smoothly. Feel free to add others. 

1. Have a plan. Know what you want, what you’ll get, entry and exit point etcetera. Zero planning translates into an endless loop of probable mistakes and losses. 

2. Keep your emotions in check. Crypto is volatile…never FOMO, stress over dips nor swing trading the markets based on emotions. Keep the emotions dead!

3. You are responsible for your own actions/decisions. Following other investor’s/influencers suggestions may get you rekt and you’ll have no recourse. 

4. Patience is key. Don’t expect overnight lambo(s) from your investment. Only those who are patient do harvest rewards. Hodl!

5. Make money. Diversify your portfolio and always buy low and sell high! Whoring between coins/tokens whenever there’s a dip hoping to recover your loss(es) will likely end up generating more losses!

6. Don’t shy away from DCAing ‘out’. It never hurts scooping out profits! That’s the main point of investing, multiplying your Benjamins and getting some if not all, out.

If you are really in it for the long run and you have a strong investment thesis then things like this is just normal market movements. There factors affecting how the market move and just because it doesn’t feed your narrative (e.g. “Guh, MoNEy sUppLy gOinG up By 100%”), doesn’t mean it’s FUD. 

Also FUD is if it is mostly contains misinformation, If it contains fact it is not FUD, just market response/reaction. If for example new covid forces lockdown (say the lockdown already happens) and market as a whole tanks, that’s not FUD, that’s just market reacting to the uncertainty (despite FUD contains uncertainty FUD’s nuance is if the uncertainty is due to misinformation).

https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/11/10/bitcoin-and-inflation/


I agree with it , I get idea behind crypto is hedge but I am not convinced , biggest runs of btc were during loose monetary policy and easy money which  might be coming to the end with Fed saying they might consider withdrawal of bond buying faster to fight inflation 

As the result of Fed comment growth stocks and over all market been completely killed with some hot stocks down as much as 75%!( Zillow, peloton etc ) , it’s a serious carnage 

Marco funds and crypto : everyone loves saying “ can’t wait for mass adoption and institutional investors” well they are in now , not geeks in basement buying pizza , and macro funds see crypto as risk on asset no matter what ppl on internet claim about “ store of value “ bla bla , stores of value don’t go down 10% in 24 hr . You wanted institutional investors , accept that it’s more correlated with markets and macro trends 

Fed is between rock and hard place , on one hand you have obviously new variants risk and no data yet how bad it can be , on other CPI readings screaming get stimulus out of system we overheating , we shall see how they will react 

My personal thoughts :

Raising Fed fund rate to fight inflation lowers valuation of assets Because now money has a price , it always hits high valuation stocks and in my opinion alt coins ( they area crypto growth stocks , networks with future use and users paying gas fees etc ) Because future growth has to be discounted by selling n DCF models 

My plans :

Crypto is around 7% I think of my portfolio, will still buy monthly and keep allocation under 10%, it’s exciting but risky , there is zero guarantee any bull cases will work out how people in this sub claim and upvote , BTC can go sideways for years , ETH 2.0 can never come or fail , you can overpay for any project and even if it will deliver price of token might stay same , keep this risks in mind and try to have a balance in your financial plan , diversification is only free lunch in investing",CryptoCurrency,"Crypto , Fed fund rate and risk assets",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r8hwg8/crypto_fed_fund_rate_and_risk_assets/,True,submission

I fomoed into Bitminutes ICO for that extra 20% bonus (yeah I know you’ve probably never heard it because it never got listed 😂) and I dumped a load of money into High Performance Blockchain which people were pretty hyped about. I was up like $8000 on it at one point and now it’s worthless. Good times.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals (Bitcoin, Eth only)

My own Custom Portfolio (What I believe would be the best portfolio in july)

Risky Portfolio (No bitcoin allowed!)

DeFi Portfolio (DeFi tokens only)

Shitcoins (shitcoins)

&amp;#x200B;

Every portfolio had $1000 to begin with. I did use CMC to track the prices of these cryptocurrencies, mainly out of laziness. It's pretty easy. Here's how I allocated the initial money for every portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, here are the specific numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With this stated, my hypothesis was the riskier portfolios would do the best, except shitcoins, which would perform the worst. Let's see what actually happened.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/joje371ec9381.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58037ceff7ae212271b9f7fa5f25c53a586ea24d)

Our top was $2285 on November 8th, nearly a month ago. Eth has outperformed Bitcoin significantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[custom portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/hut5ahoic9381.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2323c546250241ec8e3a6816e47b57f2a3ea36)

The best performer in this portfolio was Ethereum, Algorand just nearly at 2nd place, despite its own problems with inflation and such. Cardano is currently our worst performer, but it's not a large portion of our portfolio, so whatever. there was a $2200 top in the 9th of November. 

&amp;#x200B;

[risky portfolio \(no bitcoin\)](https://preview.redd.it/eq799y2nc9381.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae6f3b93a01ae4e35a99f65eccef7ce166e53d3d)

A lot of people hate Binance coin, but i didn't care, the price was low in july, and binance had a lot of regulation issues going on, which was a perfect time to gamble on it. Eth is our best performer, next to Binance coin. The worst performer is dogecoin, at 8%. 

&amp;#x200B;

The risky portfolio had a top of $2119 the 8th of November.

[deFi](https://preview.redd.it/edsbnbkrc9381.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26b989bf9bf1719633e5e12a706be01671ccd13f)

Owch, Defi has been doing bad. our best performer is Curve DAO, which i think went up a ton due to grayscale or some big institution investing into it, but every other cryptocurrency (except chainlink, arguably uniswap) has struggled during the last few months, when bitcoin has gone up 70%, only one of these cryptos have even been able to match bitcoin. It's useless to invest in anything except bitcoin if it doesn't do better than bitcoin, it's an unnecessary risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Defi had a $1770 top in early September.

I made this for fun, excepted nothing of it to be honest. at one point, it hit $3000. a 3x from its initial buy in. honestly, this portfolio doesn't even follow the others, it just goes down a ton until a shitcoin pumps super quickly super intensely, then goes down for a few more months.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the best cryptocurrency in all of these portfolios has been shib, Curve dao, Eth, Algo, binance coin. **The best performing portfolio historically has been the fundamentals portfolio,** with only bitcoin and Eth. 

&amp;#x200B;

What conclusion does this show? Sometimes people say blue chip cryptos aren't profitable. And sure, compared to some alt coin that pumps 500% one week ETH may look bad. But, it's hard to predict which alt coins WILL pump 500%. Of the 20+ cryptos here, arguably only one of them performed insanely well. And it was a shitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most cryptocurrencies that pump 500% don't hold those numbers, Eth, bitcoin, they do, they don't pump up insanely fast, but they keep the gains they made (compared to other cryptocurrencies).",CryptoCurrency,Analyzing Five Portfolios from July to December,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7qv1n/analyzing_five_portfolios_from_july_to_december/,True,submission

CRO is also an exchange backed coin, so staking on exchange = reduce fees.

If whales of SHIB and DOGE unleash, the project will tumble (like how DOGE price drop drastically after Elon SNL and has not recovered since)

Inflation is good for the poor but bad for the rich lmao.

If you are rich, it’s a positive, and since inflation is negative when you multiply, it becomes a negative. So you see, it’s basic mathinomics, and if you question it, you prolly just stupid. Respectfully.” 

Being in debt before the hit of inflation works to your advantage because technically, you now owe less money. Financially educated, wealthy people know how to use debt to their advantage. Broke people use debt to get into more debt. The rich can borrow against their own money and skip taxes; they can also pay back fast, so no need to pay the interest rates. Broke people pay the minimum, not realizing that their interest rate compounds against them.

1. **Low Scalability:** Cryptos are incapable of processing a large number of transactions. 
2. **High Cost:** Compared to regular transactions, crypto transactions have higher costs if we consider all energy being spent on transactions.
3. **Irreversibility:** We all make mistakes, often wanting to undo them, which is impossible with crypto. Money sent to the wrong person? You are at the mercy of the receiver. 
4. **Security:** Although blockchain itself is the safest concept, the personal wallets of users are not; just like phishing attacks, they are also vulnerable.
5. **Password:** If I forget my password, gone are my 100000$ into oblivion. But not in the case of banks.
6. **Inflation:** Govt control inflation by controlling repo rates, but what if, for unknown reasons, inflation increases? People will be throat to throat if it is not controlled.
7. **Oversees Control:** No control where's the money going and coming from, zero revenue for govt.
8. **Crime:** Since crypto is new, it is not very much used for crime, but with time this will evolve, and nobody can do anything about it. 

Are these concerns real? or is there's a solution to each of them? How would you debunk these?

I grew up with a passion for peer to peer systems. I used Bittorrent a lot growing up. Bittorrent allows users to use the internet to transfer files from one computer to another. So, I can share movies, music, games, etc.

When I was about 10 years old, I remember seeing Bittorrent for that first time. I watched my father torrent a song and I was blown away by it. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is one Crypto that caught my eye. It was Bittorrent's coin named ""BTT."" This coin enables users to have faster download speeds over the Bittorrent network. You can use the coin to pay ""seeders"" (other computers) to allow files to be transferred faster. 

It is in the top 100 coins (number 57 by market cap currently) with a market cap of \~$3 Billion. It has been around for around 3 years and shows potential for growth. Wallet Investeor claims ""*With a 5-year investment, the revenue is expected to be around +932.7%.""* Other investors such as Trading Beasts, Long Forecast, Digital Coin Price, GOV Capital, and the Reddit Community remain very bullish on this coin for several reasons. 

You cannot ""mine"" this coin in the traditional sense, but you CAN get it for free by keeping files on your computer and ""seeding"" them to other users. 

I am going to experiment with this later today. My question is what files should I store and from where? I assume storing popular files such as movies or games would be an excellent way to seed and get a chunk of those nice coins. 

Is there a way to automate this? Such as allow 100 GB of my hard drive to be used for this and then it automatically downloads and deletes movies or games that aren't as popular? Youtube does automatic downloads with your most popular songs and then you can listen to them offline.

&amp;#x200B;

GameStop apes have spoken to the number of shares shorted being greater than the float which gave them ammunition to trigger the MOASS. If you’re not familiar, there are multiple other subreddits to go down the rabbit hole on.

My question is around the concept of DAO’s and how they could be potentially used in the current or any future scenario like this. There are bots that are now scanning looking for unique DRS registrations to quantify the amount of shares that apes hold in order to prove that more shares were available than should have been.

Could a DAO be used as a way to collectively organize and crowdfund this type of assault on short sellers in the future? What are the pros/cons of using a DAO to help people buy shares of an organization in this type of scenario?

Once again, this is not a post about a specific token coin or stock, rather a hypothetical question about the validity of a decentralized approach to a problem.

So, I've been pretty proud of myself figuring out the different addresses, networks, wallets, seed phrases, etc etc… .    
  
KuCoin has just made me say forget about it… .   

It is still all in vain.   

There is no way I want to put any money until I learn more and I've been happy with moons, ROYs, ONE and other stuff. However, being American blocks me at every pass. I haven't been in America in many years and and no local exhanges allow American usage. No Coinbase, Binance, Nothing…    
  
I've checked the 'no kyc' recommendations and they still want kyc to trade or withdraw.    
  
I can't add fiat even if I had it because it is seemingly just impossible to add fiat to buy anything without verification.     
   
 But, I was still having a little fun swapping and moving things around... but it wouldn't let me get to actual BTC. So, playing around with ROY and ONE and even NANO didn't seem like it had any value to me cause I couldn't do anything with it.

Then, I came to KuCoin. It was on a no kyc list. However, when I tried to add fiat, they want kyc from BANX. Anyway,  I figure now, I don't need fiat. I have made a few ROYs and made them into ONE. I saw that I could swap my ONE for BTC on KuCoin. Sent a few ONE to KuCoin.    
  
Pretty excites to get in finally.. and have an ever so tiny piece of BTC.     
   
They took my ONE... but now, I can't trade, withdraw, anything without KYC and ""American"" isn't even an option for citizenship. It has been such a hassle as an American, with no ties to America, living in another country.      
    
I really just don't get it. How is this anonymous, global, etc etc When kyc, gov't control, and all the policies and procedures block it all for me.

Its truly incredible the misconceptions they're able to feed people about how bitcoin works. Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy - everyone understands that - the issue is their way of comparing and deriving their numbers.

The first thing most media seems to do which is absolutely bonkers and I dont know why people dont talk about this more. They like to take the total energy consumption of Bitcoin and divide it by the number of supposed transactions to say how much a transaction costs in energy. The reality is most of the energy is going towards the process of mining/the proof of work, and less than 10% is focused on transactions.

Do we take the entire energy consumption of a business like a bank and divide it by number of transactions? Certainly not. The majority of their energy is for data centers, daily office use, and running servers - a portion is towards facilitating payments. Included in the common argument that a visa transaction is a tiny fraction compared to a bitcoin transaction is the fact that with banks and traditional financial institutions, the transactions include those done by third parties. Of course in the bitcoin conversation, nobody is bringing up the countless exchanges and trading platforms where btc is being traded for low fees - most of the fee is probably going to the service if its centralized.

Thats how we get to this headline ""Every Bitcoin transaction consumes over $100 in electricity""

Just in the snippet of the paywall blocked article theres so many issues:

"" The report states that each Bitcoin transaction consumes 1,173 kilowatt hours of electricity. That's the volume of energy that could ""power the typical American home for six weeks,"" the authors add. The Bitcoin mining that enables a purchase, sale or transfer, it posits, uses a slug of electricity that costs $176. That number is based on an average worldwide cost per kWh of 9.0 cents over the past 12 months. ""

First, they take the total energy consumption of bitcoin - say 200 TWh and divide by 365 days and an average of about 300k transactions per day you get 1,826 kwhs per transaction. Realistically, the cost of the transaction is 5-10% of that at the absolute most, and more than likely its a lot lower. So thats where they're getting the 1173 from (slightly diff numbers at the time) - so obviously, thats not the case - a transaction doesn't actually cost that much.

For comparison ive done some research and it looks like a company such as JP Morgan uses about 2.3 TWh which is obviously a small fraction of 150-200 we're looking at for bitcoin - but thats one bank. Thats where you get the numbers that bitcoin uses half as much as the worlds banking system. Something to point out is ATMs around the world use somewhere in the neighborhood of 30-50 TWh per year total according to my statistics. 3 million ATMs and an average of 50Kwhs per day.

It is also becoming a common practice for renewable energy providers who have excess energy to sell it to mining corporations. This serves a ton of useful purposes because otherwise the energy would be completely wasted. It can also help finance/pay off the debt of energy providers and allow them to invest elsewhere. When building an energy station you obviously build it to power more than the current needs, as you assume its needs will grow. This excess can be siphoned to miners quickly and easily to help pay off debt - leads to more projects/infrastructure being built with funds (hopefully).

"" Globally, estimates of Bitcoin's use of renewables range from **about 40 percent to almost 75 percent**. But in general, experts say, using renewable energy to power Bitcoin mining means it won't be available to power a home, a factory or an electric car. ""

seriously what is this shit? Youre saying bitcoin is using a ton of renewable energy, but thats not enough so we'll say its stealing energy from others.

Anyways, just my thoughts on the portrayal of BTC in the media. Yes, it does use a lot of energy but more and more each year is from renewables, and I (obviously) believe the juice is worth the squeeze. Comment below.

And with the *frequency* of the appearance of threads like these, I can only imagine this would feel the same as, if not similar to, being a bitcoin holder or exchange owner in 2010 or 2011. People would accuse you left and right of buying drugs or money laundering even if you were simply a law-abiding citizen that was in it for the long haul.                

Yes we can go in to the ethics of use case, and even though I myself am *somewhat* skeptical of NFTs, this realization has actually made me decide to do some research and put some money in to some NFTs.

1) Does adding a network (eg. BSC) permanently enable you to receive any of its token using the same receive address in the ETH receive tab? Does that mean there is only one address to send all of the different token from different networks?

2) I saw in a video that you cannot receive a different networks token unless you add it first. The problem is I added it to my browser extension but when I used the seed phrase to log in into my mobile wallet, only ETH network was shown. Does this mean if I deleted my browser extension and didn't add BSC to my mobile wallet, I'll lose the tokens I send to the main address?

3) Why doesn't MetaMask add BSC and a bunch of other popular networks by default? I see a bunch of useless testnets added, which suggests they have the technology to add BSC as well.

I am, however, unsure about its future given that most people (myself included) would just opt for a free cloud service.

**About the blockchain:** If I understand it correctly, the blockchain is meant to provide the users and hosts with a smart contract for the storage of encrypted information. Pretty neat idea! I can see many people using it to store documents related to private stuff (like accounting data) that you can't afford to lose or upload to the cloud with a service like Drive or Dropbox, but that isn't important enough to store in something more expensive such as the blockchain in Arweave.

**Pros:** It seems to be redundant enough, dividing a file into 30 pieces whilst needing only 10 to recover it. It's also relatively easy and intuitive to become a Host, lending spare space and earn Siacoin, and I like the distribution of the coin among the biggest wallets. 

**Cons:** I think you need their wallet to use the service. Besides, if you pay for bandwidth uploading and downloading, it would be expensive to access your files frequently.

I am doing some market research trying to see if people still use p2p crypto trading services such as Local Bitcoins or Paxful or Binance p2p?

Do you still use services such as LocalBitcoins or Paxful to exchange cryptocurrencies locally and globally? If yes, please list your service in the comments section. 

If no, please state why you dislike the service and would not use their services or would like to look for different services. 

The reason being is that I am starting a P2P Exchange and would like to know if I could find some individuals that want to sell or buy their cryptos on the platform.

The platform has all the features of LocalBitcoins and Paxful put together. I just need some willing participants that would like to become pioneers in the endeavor. 

What I would ultimately like to end up getting out of this a general overview of how many people still actually use p2p crypto marketplaces to make crypto trades. Here is a brief overview of the project.

1. Zero Fees

One of the most appealing features of CrowTrades P2P is that it is free to use. When it comes to CrowTrades P2P, unlike many other P2P platforms, you won't have to worry about giving a share of your transactions. With no hidden costs, you get exactly what you paid for.

2. A Variety of Payment Options

You may send and receive money for your transactions using any of the more than 150+ payment methods offered onCrowTrades P2P.

3. Completion Rates Are High

CrowTrades makes sure to hold a high standard for its P2P market through strict rules for sellers. To keep their access to the platform, they must execute transactions promptly and with a high level of satisfaction. 

4. Service of Escrow

As one of several safeguards on the platform, the CrowTrades P2P’s escrow service includes a reserve mechanism for crypto money invested in any pending transaction. This method avoids theft or scams by establishing a second degree of trust, preventing scammers from taking your money or cryptocurrency without completing their side of the transaction.

5. Transactions Are Swiftly Completed

Merchants can limit the transaction lengths to 15 minutes on P2P platforms. This implies that you may complete a secure and fast P2P transaction with selected merchants in under 15 minutes.

Escrow Service

CrowTrades offers crypto escrow in all P2P deals to protect consumers' crypto assets. The quantity of crypto for the ad is immediately withheld from the seller's wallet when the ad is placed. This implies that if the seller takes your money and does not deliver your crypto, or if the seller forgets to release your crypto on time, the customer service team of CrowTrades can transfer the asset from the seller's wallet's reserved funds to your wallet.

Customer Support

If you encounter a problem during a P2P trade and are unable to reach an agreement with your counterparty, you can seek assistance from CrowTrades customer care staff. To investigate and resolve issues, the customer service staff will contact consumers through email.

You may also file appeals to report and safeguard other users from suspicious individuals. If a person attempts to persuade you to make a deal outside the CrowTrades P2P platform, ignore them and file a complaint. Remember, CrowTrades cannot protect you if you perform trading outside of the site.

How we keep our customers safe:

For any ad to be placed on our platform the escrowed wallet has to be funded first. If there are no funds in your escrow wallet, your ad will not show. If you do not have enough funds in your escrowed wallet and you try to sell more than you have, your ad will not show.

Hearing whispers about bitcoin and other ""cryptos"" from our friends, coworkers, family. So we do a little research, mull it over for a few days maybe, and end up buying in.

The Wyckoff Method. 
This is a super interesting theory from the 1930's that explains that institutional and big investors play with retail investors (you) emotions with FOMO to sell you their cheaply accumulated stocks  when price is high and FUD in order make you sell your stock to them when prices are low. If you understand how these big players are manipulating the general investor you will make not fall prey to them, but rather learn to buy when they buy (ie the dip) and sell when they sell (if your not a HODLer) then you will feel more incontrol and less like your being played.

GREED/FEAR/HOPE. 
Figure out how these affect your decisions to buy at the wrong time, sell and wrong time and hold when you shouldn't. HODLing and DCAing (down cost averaging) are great strategies for emotionless investing. 

Basic chart analysis skills.
Learn to know when a crypto is trending down (bear market) and trending up (bull market) and trending sideways (may go up or down). Learn about ""break out patterns"" and bear traps (make you buy when price still falling) and bull traps (make you sell when you should hold). Learn about when a crypto is OVER BOUGHT and OVER SOLD. Of cause if your a HODLer or DCAer then you don't need to know this, but its still interesting to be able to read the market.

Avoid shitcoins, low market cap coins, margin trading and futures:
Shitcoins have no real value or purpose. Low market cap coins are subject to pump and dumps. Margin lending is high reward but high risk, don't fall prey to greed. Futures is basically gambling, you might win once, then lose it all the next time.

Follow the right news.
From personal experience, I got into crypto because of mainstream media stories which seem to peak in volume around when BTC and ETH are reaching ATHs. This sucks, you fall prey to FOMO, invest and see nothing but red. Don't follow this news. Personally I check up on CoinMarketCap.com app news aggregate stories related to specific cryptos in the news that day.
You will see a link between cryptos getting a ton of attention for some good reason and an increase in demand this value. TIP: if a reputable (top 10) crypto is receiving  alot of hype in crypto centric news, and your chart analysis indicates that is oversold and due for a rally, then it may be worth buying some.

Paper trade or demo account first.
There is nothing more exciting and scary then investing with real money. If your gonna HODL and DCA then this probable isn't nessecary. But if your more od a swing and day trader inclined person then practice with a demo account first to make mistakes and learn from them. Most trading platforms offer some sort of demo account.


To conclude.
Don't gamble your hard earned money, dont invest money you can afford to lose. Arm yourself with knowledge and the tools to make informed and timely decisions when and why to buy and sell. When in doubt, BUY THE DIP, HODL and DCA. But if you have a curious mind like me, learn abit more about the workings of market. Your journey will be more successful earlier and less stressful.",CryptoCurrency,Advice from one new crypto trader other new crypto traders,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r66h5w/advice_from_one_new_crypto_trader_other_new/,True,submission

*But* now that I'm thinking about the nature of asynchronous encryption, and how the private key is paired with the public key, I'm wondering why a public/private key pair wouldn't be more or less universal.

So after that post a few days ago where somebody asked what it would take to consistently earn $500 a month off of crypto, I realized that I was probably making a good bit more than that from my interest payments on binance (combined with the other services I use, I was probably making over $1k a month on interest). Unfortunately, as an American, I can no longer use binance - not even with a VPN - and, as such, I've been transitioning to other things. One of those things is Nexo. Now while their interest rates are not nearly as good as the non-US binance (nobody else seems to be able to match them either though), I'm kind of limited in my options. But one of the... I guess you could say ""interesting"" things is that Nexo ups their interest payouts based on how much of your portfolio is their NEXO token. Unfortunately, it seems like the interest bump is pretty minor - in order to get a 1% bump, at least 10% of your portfolio - and the only position I have that I would even consider exchanging for that large a quantity of NEXO would be a portion of my BNB holdings. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is this: hypothetically, if you had around 107 BNB, would you exchange... let's say 10 BNB for an equivalent value of NEXO in order to get a 1% interest bump on cryptos held in nexo? I don't really know much about nexo - the platform or the coin - so I'm kind of at a crossroads here and not sure what to do. I don't care about any other coins here, and I'm only really interested in hearing about another platform if it's offering more than 5% interest on a given token. But yeah, I feel like I highlighted all the variables here. I might make like 4 or 5 edits here later though. Tough to say.",CryptoCurrency,NEXO vs. BNB.

[https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

As Victor Hugo said once:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

I recently got ownership of [r/etica](https://www.reddit.com/r/etica/) and this is where I plan to organise the emerging community. If you are interested in this project make sure you join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/). It is the very very begining (as I'm writing there are only 5 members on [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/) haha).

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

DeafCoin introduces the Deaf community to decentralized finance and Algorand. Further, the team behind DeafCoin works to educate the Deaf community on finance, cryptocurrency, and other investments.

What is DeafCoin?

""DeafCoin ($DEAF) is a cryptocurrency designed for the Deaf ecosystem. It was minted by the head of the Deafcore team, an awardwinning Deaf educator passionate about Deaf education, language deprivation in deaf children, and economic disparities associated with the D/deaf and hard-of-hearing population.

As a community asset, DeafCoin introduces the Deaf community to decentralized finance and Algorand. Further, the team behind DeafCoin works to educate the Deaf community on finance, cryptocurrency, and other investments."" - [Whitepaper](https://www.deafcore.com/white-paper)

First lets discuss the objective of this token. Their website states as follows """"Deafcore is a company that adheres to the mantra of ""Entertainment, Education, and Immersion in American Sign Language (ASL).""

Through up-to-date and visual technology, Deafcore seeks to empower the Deaf community through education, consultancy, gaming, and professional development.

Currently, Deafcore is developing ""Project Pear Tree,"" a mobile game that makes learning American Sign Language easy and fun. The game will be powered by an Algorand cryptocurrency based asset, DeafCoin. We work closely with the Deaf community to promote the ASL and Deaf ecosystem.

In addition, we provide consultancy and professional development in Deaf Education and American Sign Language. All professional development offered by Deafcore is supported by the latest research, cutting-edge technology, and high levels of engagement"" - [Website](https://www.deafcore.com/) ['About' Page](https://www.deafcore.com/about)

Secondly I would like to direct to the fact that this token has already been verified with a transparent and engaged team, led by u/ TheDeafBison. They waited until all ducks were in a row before even bothering to launch and go public to the world. There is a drive behind this team to help better the world for the deaf community.

Next as I said the whitepaper was just posted today. Reading through this filled me with more confidence in the project. They have plans laid out all the way through August 2023. With the development of both a learning game and a teaching platform. Youtube videos IN ASL soon to go live as well!

Whitepaper breaks down the initial 10mil supply (3.5mil circulating) as follows:

• 500,000 (5%) - DeafCoin creator

• 500,000 (5%) - DeafCoin development and team

• 1,000,000 (10%) - Reserved tokens for future Deafcore-created platforms ([Project Pear Tree](https://www.deafcore.com/peartree) mobile game and [DeafTeach](https://www.deafcore.com/deafteach) learning platform)

• 1,000,000 (10%) - The Deaf Ecosystem (Tokens to be donated or sold to schools for the Deaf; non-profits and foundations; Deafowned businesses and other enterprises)

• 3,000,000 (30%) – Permanent liquidity pools and decentralized exchanges

• 4,000,000 (40%) – Loyalty rewards, participation rewards, and other decentralization initiatives

Things I think I need help with: I have TIME tokens in my MetaMask ETH main net wallet. I have linked to AVAX and I’ve tried sending myself .1 TIME. It never shows up in my wallet. I see the transaction on etherscan, but from what I understand , if you send to the wrong network - your shit just poofs - gone - no recovery. I want to know what I have done wrong? - I’m considering just swapping it back to ETH but I have a pretty serious trust issue with both MetaMask and my own competence at this point so I’m hesitant to do anything. 

Anyway. Fascinating stuff now that I have more than just a passing of its existence as a Lambo generator 🤣

Smart contracting has extended this notion a little bit but essentially this is still only that.

The expectation that a single technology will be deployed in all areas of life is just ridiculous. Distributed systems are long used for bringing tons of value under the hood, without the hype. ( well, some hype )

Bitorrent, distributed databases (Cassandra, CockroachDB), Kubernetes and Zookeeper and even hyperledger.

These solutions are being used heavily in the industry to generate a lot of value. Yet, despite most of them having lots of similarities to blockchain technologies, none of them are evaluated for billions, they are just solutions with specific use cases and that's it.

I still hold firm in the success of some blockchains. But you should definitely think about what a blockchain is and what is can be used for.

A few days ago I met with these two self built empire entrepreneurs type of people and somehow I have been given the chance of attending the conversation by my boss. 

It all came down to the point where they were talking about how to survive the during financial crisis that my countries going through. 

One of the engineers did an open sort of suggestion by signaling crypto assets and how theres high chances of growth in the market which even more for the people who can afford to surf along the market fluctuations.

Until at that point in the conversation I took those people pretty seriously and I somehow tricked by their words and made solid conclusions about their experiences and such but the guy I liked the most caused a huge turnover by calling crypto as a drugdealing platform and that was a huge turn off for me.

I mean how can you possibly be earning a few millions a year and make such an assumption for one of the greatest breakouts in the history of finance/economy. 

I had a really good story to share to the crowd but I am a shy person and I kept it in my chest for some reason.. 

Nevertheless people are still very ignorant and prejudiced about crypto even if you think or they seem like they are not or they might not be. 

Dont be like me spread the word!

My best friend used to be an heroine addict for 6 years and he withdrew heroine by getting hooked into crypto. 

He even made his dealer quit being a baller and made him start to trade crypto as well. Now they are digging like moles thus they made a lot of gains.

I read [this article](https://www.cryptonewsz.com/what-will-happen-when-the-sleeping-blockchain-giants-awake/) that mentions some projects that might pick up steam soon, and for reference it's:

* EOS, which is a blockchain with an app that wants to help devs make dapps faster. It launched 2018.
* Qtum, which wants to combine Ethereum's smart contract system with Bitcoin's UTXO. It launched its mainnet on 2017.
* Wanchain, which aims for interoperability by using proxy tokens to facilitate inter-chain transactions. It launched its mainnet on 2018.

Basing on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)'s history, it launched on 2016 and the CRO token took off in 2018 soon after. But it's only recently that it made headlines, right?

The main reason someone would want to buy ETH (other than speculation) would be to participate in the Eth network (e.g. defi, NFTs).

With Ethereum competitors with low fees, you see people buying $5 just to pay for gas fees to buy shitcoins or mint NFTs.

Since ethereum has such high fees these people need to buy higher amounts of ETH to trade shitcoins or do whatever they want to do. 

If I want to buy a shitcoin on ETH I need to buy at least $50 of eth for gas fees, while if I want to buy a shitcoin on harmony I can buy 50 cents worth of ONE and it'll last me a lifetime of trading or minting NFTs 24/7.

As I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qz2o4u/were_all_looking_at_the_price_when_we_should_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), the only way out of the taxes is for people is to use credit against their crypto.

One thing I should stress further is that individuals do not have the same access to credit as businesses do b/c individuals' assets (like the car and the house) aren't sufficiently liquid in the market for low interest rates; securities, on the other hand, e.g., stocks and bonds, are perfect for this, despite not necessarily generating high-yield.

Considering this, I'm wondering if anyone, like myself, has thought of creating a legal entity (as in, their own company, e.g., an LLC) for all financial and crypto-related ventures. My personal goal is to be able to get an ultra-stable stream of supplemental income from the business, continuing to fund it until I can pretty much retire off of it.

The business would also potentially open up access to many other yield-generation schemes, such as a self-managed stake pool and so forth; you could also do this as an individual, but then you'd be answerable to Big Brother if they start tracking IP addresses from AWS and questioning the owner/payer of the pertinent accounts or something (I'm VERY bearish on an overreaching sovereign state).

On the Fiat side, it would be really nice to operate as a legal entity and have access to the same credit markets that companies have (I hear small business loans are becoming increasingly popular these days); this way, you would be able to get debt positions against your crypto and diversify into, e.g., real estate, metals, and debt securities (government and corporate bonds). Real estate would be especially convenient as, with an LLC, you're not personally liable if a renter falls off the balcony and sues you or something (frivolous lawsuits are themselves a huge industry in this country, unfortunately); in fact, I'm pretty sure there's not even a rule against living in a house owned by your LLC, as long as you can prove that you own the company. Again, you could get into these markets as an individual too, but as is the meta in this sub, regulators are incompetent swine looking to make a quick buck by harassing the middle class until they get their cut; you're generally much better protected as a legal entity with an accountant and lawyer on retainer.

How to pay yourself: Once your company starts making profits, you could structure payments to your personal bank account through a regular salary or other general disbursements (this is the kind of thing a small business accountant does, so YMMV). If you're able to start cutting down on debt and getting profits from your company, all you have to do is scale up until you can achieve whatever lifestyle you want in your personal life.

My long-term dream: I'm a simple guy, pretty much all I want is a nice house, a reliable car, and a sufficiently-large rainy day fund; beyond that, I'm trying to cut personal expenses as much as possible.  However, I'm also obsessed with cats and dogs (I'm neither a cat person nor a dog person, I just love them both), so it'd be huge for me to be able to securely set aside all the money my future pet(s) would need in his/her/their lifetime(s) and also be able to either fund a local animal shelter or even start my own as a nonprofit.

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS) is a way to give ""shares"" of a secret to a group of people such that when a certain number of shares are combined the original secret can be recovered. However individual shares and groups of shares below the chosen threshold reveal 0 information and do not help in brute forcing the secret. 

There is an open source implementation for Android and IOS linked at the bottom of the post, as well as a website which can actually be used more securely than the app.

## Here's how to use it:

* Download the app

* In the ""Secret Message"" box, paste your private key or recovery phrase. 

Obviously anytime you do this be very careful. Consider reviewing the app source or even asking or paying someone else to. I haven't reviewed it myself, but I trust most open source projects.

* Put a number in the ""Threshold"" box. 

This is how many people with their shares have to come together and cooperate to recover the wallet.

* Put a number in the shares box

This is how many people total will receive a share of the secret.

* Press the ""SPLIT!"" button.

* Copy each share and give it to someone you trust very much.

Explain to them that they should securely store the share forever, and it can be used with other shares to recover your crypto funds if you lose access or die. Let them know who else is getting shares and that they should never share their share until it's time to recover your funds. Also make sure they get the app as well. Other SSSS implementations may not be compatible and able to recover the secret from the same shares.

Keep the list of shares yourself as securely as you keep your private key, alongside the names of those who have each share. If someone ever loses their share, be sure to give them the EXACT SAME ONE you gave them the first time, so that they don't make progress towards recovering your private key by ""losing"" it.

### Recovering the key

* Click the ""Combine"" tab.

* Paste one share on each line.

* Press the ""COMBINE!"" button.

### How it works at a high level:

Imagine you have the equation of a line, and it crosses the y axis at a secret number. If you give one point on the line to someone, they have no way to find the secret number as there are an infinite possible number of lines that cross their single point.

If two people come together with two unique points, they can plot the line and easily find the secret number at the y axis.

If you use a parabola instead of a line, 3 points are necessary to find the secret number. If you use a function whose highest exponent is n, n+1 points are needed.

Then you do some magic with finite fields and integers and you get SSSS.

BNT was a really big comeup for me earlier this year. I made a lot of money in a very short time but I've forgotten about it for the most part since then. I don't even have it on my tradingview lists any more.

I read today about v3 of their AMM launching and it has some really neat sounding features. The two that are interesting to me is their impermanent loss protection and their new Omnipool. You apparently don't have to stake on one particular pair and instead you deposit BNT to their Omnipool and get a fraction of each trade fee that is produced via **any** trade on their DEX.

I've been out of the defi game for a while (I got hosed once and that left a sour taste in my mouth) but once these guys start offering a Polygon Network option instead of ETH I am going to get back in. No idea when that will be but it looks really interesting and I think these guys are underrated.

[https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

As Victor Hugo said it:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

I recently got ownership of [r/etica](https://www.reddit.com/r/etica/) and this is where I plan to organise the emerging community. If you are interested in this project make sure you join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/). It is the very very begining (as I'm writing there are only 5 members on [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/) haha).

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

The thing is that CRO is a CEX Crypto coin that is one of the most centralised Crypto’s ever. I put my money (or did not in this situation) where my mouth is and did not purchase a single CRO Coin despite of the potential profits. 

I don’t know what is happening, but it seems like the culture of this sub is shifting rapidly to profit over values and I personally find it hypocritical that this is the case. I don’t know if you guys remember, but BNB was/still is one of the most hated Coins ever in this sub for being the exact same thing CRO is.

We need to remember that Satoshi would have never wanted such a a thing to even occur let alone thrive. CEX's should just focus on running a reputable exchange and that is it. We should leave the Coin/Token development to independent founders who aim to be as decentralised as possible with little to no control with fair distribution.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) typically have a governance token/unit that allows token holders to vote on the strategic actions of the organization. The tokens also allow members of the DAO to compensate each other for contributions to an agreed-upon mission. Some DAOs buy land, others bid on artifacts, price carbon, or reshape politics. Decentralized coordination at the scale of DAOs has not been done before in human history. We are watching a new form of governance being developed, and as DAOs collide with traditional organizations we are witnessing the reshaping of our world. If DAOs are not sufficiently decentralized they risk finding themselves becoming centralized as they try to compete with traditional entities. As DAOs brush against the traditional ecosystem, many will adopt traditional means of coordination as they try to compete with traditional entities. Since decentralized organizations have not been “battle” tested, the ability for DAOs to remain uncorrupted is unknown. DAOs could be nudged towards a centralized entity's motives due to a lack of token holder participation, or by individuals sponsored by centralized entities outworking unsponsored individuals, bribery is also a potential attack vector. As the ecosystem expands, it will have to address these questions or risk losing to traditional entities.

There are three main areas that DAOs need to focus on as they continue to scale and brush against the traditional world. They must:

1. Improve the DAO onboarding &amp; benefits experience
2. Increase token holder participation
3. Create alternatives to Discord

**Improve the DAO onboarding &amp; benefits experience**

The benefit of working at a traditional company is that business processes have been refined over decades. Human resources in 1990 and human resources in 2020 are fairly similar. HR at DAOs will be radically different, at a traditional company a person completes onboarding, in a DAO the individual’s journey looks closer to a video game. In games, an individual's enthusiasm determines the outcome. Some grind the intro levels while others jump from one main event to the next. DAOs need to accommodate and entice both types of people, those who read all an organization’s documentation and those who jump in headfirst. Right now DAOs rely on the enthusiasm of new members but this won’t scale to the next billion people in web3/crypto. In nations where healthcare is not guaranteed by the state, DAOs will need to step in to provide benefits, preferably in a decentralized manner. The closest entity the ecosystem has may be Opolis but it is not a perfect entity. Currently, most DAOs have a similar onboarding process. An individual hears about the DAO through word of mouth or social media. Then the individual lurks on a discord server, eventually deciding to join some kind of intro call after reading an introductory medium post of some kind. The individual then completes some kind of initial starting “quest”. What comes next is unknown, maybe a member of the DAO reaches out to the individual or maybe a member of the DAO doesn’t. The onboarding process should mirror that of an RPG video game, engaging, easy, and offering clear progression steps.

**Increase token holder participation**

Voter participation needs to be increased so that centralized entities cannot exert influence over DAOs and ensure that DAOs are correctly able to assess the true thoughts of token holders. If nation-states or BlackRock decided to begin accumulating tokens for a particular project, to maintain decentralization would the appropriate response be to fork the project? Doing so would cause institutional capital in crypto to dry up. If the crypto ecosystem wants institutional capital it must figure out how to progress beyond simple token votes. In such systems whales dominate, causing a lack of enthusiasm from smaller token holders. Once the “little” guy believes that their vote has no power, turnout drops and all we have succeeded in doing is recreating the current political and economic system with move hoops. Multiple voting types should also be explored such as quadratic voting. 

&gt;*“Quadratic voting is defined as collective decision-making procedure that involves individuals allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. Quadratic voting works by allowing users to ""pay"" for additional votes on a given matter to express their support for given issues more strongly, resulting in voting outcomes that are aligned with the highest willingness to pay outcome, rather than just the outcome preferred by the majority regardless of the intensity of individual preferences.”*   
&gt;  
&gt;\- *Lalley, Steven; Weyl, E. Glen*

Individuals with large financial stakes in a DAO’s ecosystem should not exert undue influence over those with a smaller stake. voter participation may be incentivized through penalties for not participating in votes. To counteract these issues, failure to participate in votes may need to be penalized through slashing voting power, fees, or some other kind of mechanism. This creates a scenario where there are real consequences for not voting. Much like Australia which penalizes its citizens for not participating in elections, DAOs should explore the possibility of penalizing token holders for not engaging in governance.

**Create alternatives to Discord**

Discord has risen to prominence as the de facto communication mechanism for DAOs in the crypto ecosystem. As DAOs experiment and change the nature of governance, introducing a large point of centralization with Discord servers seems contrary to the mission/ethos of DAOs. Discord servers are regularly hacked by sophisticated users and armies of bots exist to compromise servers. A decentralized communications platform needs to be created so that DAO members have a platform to communicate on. Discord has already shown that in times of extreme duress, they can and will shut down servers. If a server was to be shut down during a time where a DAO was competing with a traditional entity, this would cripple the DAO. Allowing the entire DAO ecosystem to grow and continue to use Discord would be a critical misstep.

**Conclusion**

The explosion of DAO activity has shown the need for decentralized “plumbing”. Decentralized government, web services, onboarding, and payroll are all needed to onboard the next batch of builders to the web3/crypto ecosystem. As DAOs compete with traditional institutions, they will need to balance a need to remain competitive with the need to remain decentralized. This assumes that decentralized decision-making remains slower than traditional top-down decision-making. If DAOs can develop the “plumbing” necessary to scale and grow, they will outcompete traditional corporations. If not, we risk losing the essence of the crypto ecosystem as we compete with traditional players.

I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Despite multiple requests through email, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CainBCHA/status/1454350013866266629?s=20), Telegram, Reddit, and even an [article](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/reddit-user-calls-out-kucoin-over-%e2%89%8850000-stuck-on-exchange/) published on a popular crypto news site, I've yet to get any substantial response from Kucoin or their CEO u/Johnny_Kucoin. No apologies, no explanations, no timetable for when I can expect my money. 

===

As many of you predicted, Kucoin has done nothing to resolve my issue. Here's what I wish had happened. After seeing my posts, Johnny or some other Kucoin representative would have replied with a clear explanation of the situation and a promise to make things right within a reasonable time frame. But instead what I got was more of the same:

[Btw, it is a simple change. No other exchanges have had this problem. And I don't want your gratitude, I want you to do your job.](https://preview.redd.it/ewkr7z30pg281.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=504d556044252c3eb98089a0a7411d946a7532d8)

[It's been in progress for months. And what about withdrawals?](https://preview.redd.it/spf8h2q7pg281.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e511d287c3857a61d19a3b6f4b5d66c8d2feaea4)

Since what I wanted to happen didn't happen, here's what I hope happens next. I want as many people as possible to withdraw their funds from Kucoin.

I believe in crypto because it gives us the ability take back control of our money. And believe me, I hold the vast majority of my wealth on various cold storage devices, but I can't take custody of my funds if the exchange never lets me, if they take my money but won't give me what I paid for.

Imagine going into a store and buying something, but after paying for your item they say you're not allowed to take it home. They say to come back later, but each time you do, they only tell you they're working on it without so much as a sorry.

This is what Kucoin is basically doing to me and countless others based on the comments I got on my last post. [Their subreddit is full of people's complaints](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/comments/qu36l4/kucoin_weekly_support_thread_november_15_november/), and it's barely been a month since good old Johnny was here on this very subreddit trying to defend himself against allegations that his exchange was [using Cloudflare to deny website access during big price movement to profit on liquidations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qedj6t/kucoin_is_using_cloudflare_to_deny_website_access/)

Maybe you've been fortunate and haven't had any issues with Kucoin, but there's no way to know if you might be next. Are you willing to take that risk?

I want people to withdraw their funds from Kucoin to send a message. This is how the market is supposed to work. If you treat your customers poorly, eventually you will lose those customers. After all, if the market doesn't provide the proper feedback, we can't blame anyone but ourselves for having to deal with such incompetence.

I think the crypto community has a golden opportunity here. An opportunity to make a statement that exchanges must answer to their users, not the other way around. This is exactly what crypto was made for. Not only for us to no longer have to rely on trusted third parties, but also to force any trusted third parties to do better. 

Look, I don't expect all 8 million of Kucoin's users to suddenly withdraw their coins, but if I can get just enough of you to do so, it might finally get their attention.

I'm not trying to cancel Kucoin. I just want them to get their act together and start treating their customers right.

So if you belive in the power of crypto and it's true purpose, please share this story. Post it to other subreddits, spread it on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Weibo, Wechat, Kakao, and Facebook. And if you have a Kucoin account, please withdraw your funds to a hardware device or at least to a more trustworthy exchange. Not only to send a message to Kucoin, but to protect yourselves from ending up in my situation. Because the last thing you want is for everyone else to withdraw before you get a chance to do so yourself.",CryptoCurrency,The Kucoin Chronicles: Part 3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r4nvjz/the_kucoin_chronicles_part_3/,True,submission

I see many comments and posts each time it happens in an obvious way (usually accompanying a fast swing by BTC) calling it out and either asking why it occurs or attributing it to some organized manipulation. Even some well-intentioned commenters explain how there is increased confidence in the markets during a bitcoin surge and so investors jump in alts at the same time. The same can be said about a sudden fall, where bitcoin loses value suddenly and all the alts follow suite. 

When I first started in crypto, I’ll admit it confused me too. But now it makes sense and hopefully it will to you too. 

Alts are markets inside markets. Bitcoin is nested in the fiat market and alts are nested in the Bitcoin market. 
In order to understand why cryptos rise and fall with bitcoin, you need to stop thinking of alts directly in fiat value, that’s too many steps. This isn’t like stocks where everything is traded against the USD. This is crypto, where everything is traded against other crypto and the reserve currency is Bitcoin. As the largest share of trading pairs, BTC is the market stabilizer in the same sort of way that the USD is the reserve currency in the global market. Yes we have stable coins, but they don’t dominate the market like the bitcoin pairs. 

When we compare the value of two cryptos we can forget that we are actually looking at their value in yet a third currency. You may be only looking at two coins but you are including a third trading pair of fiat.  Instead, keep it simple and consider only two assets, one trading pair, at a time. During a shared price movement, look at the value of your coin and it’s movements in its value in bitcoin and you’ll see an accurate market value of your coin within crypto. The magic of the price of all coins moving in harmony falls away. If there is a significant change against BTC, you at least have a proper baseline for seeing true movement of your coins divergence from the baseline within crypto. Now you can introduce the fiat market into consideration if you want. It is the tertiary market in this trio.

Let’s make a quick oversimplified example to drive the point home: 

If I were to buy shares in the American company Apple, which is valued in USD, and then the USD somehow suddenly rose 3% in value, would I be surprised that both the USD and the apple stock I own both increased 3% when I lookup the value in Euros? Of course not. Apple is still worth the exact same USD as before. Now since the Euro is smaller you may say the Euro fell 3% instead. It’s all relative but the point is the dollar moved and Apple stock did not, unless you care about Apple’s value in terms of a third asset. In crypto, fiat is the third asset.

At first I thought the problem was on gate's side seeing the transaction ID (txid) was approved on Coinspot's side. I did a Blockchain Explorer on the Stellar coins and it couldn't detect it.

So what I learned, if the txid doesn't appear on Blockchain Explorer, the problem is with the original source, so, in my case - Coinspot. I contacted them and sure enough, the problem was on their side and I got the coins back to Coinspot.

Sorry for the bright picture but the volume is hard to see otherwise. Anyways, we are seeing a downward trend when it comes to volume. 

# This is why we are seeing massive drops and a hard time it going up

Basically, the whale are pumping it or maybe a ton of us normal people are pumping it. But it takes almost no large amount to lower the price. There isn't as many involved in crypto trading like there once was.

# Good news:

We been almost at the same level when it comes to volume for 4 months now (August). This means we should start to see the dip massively slow down. Also while we are in new areas. We have seen in the past like Oct of last year when volume leveled like it is now. We see a massive increase in price (from $10k to $60k). 

NOTE: I'm not saying lets expect anything like a 6x ($360k). I'm saying we are consolidating where it becomes extremely hard to lower the price and we are seeing in the past where this happens before jumps.

&amp;#x200B;

# A few side things to note:

The first and biggest is outside factors. One of the biggest things that helped us toward the start of this year was things like the stimulus checks. Like it or not, we most likely will get another round of this depending on this new virus. Reports have confirm it is in Europe, there is reports saying the likely has traveled to Canada from Europe and through that USA. Here in the USA we are already seeing military being deploy to hospitals in areas like Colorado, a massive uptick in cases, a spike in deaths, and so on. Like nothing is official about it being here but all signs are showing it is already here.

Now what this means is likely another round of lock downs in most areas, many workers will be out of the job because the type of job they had (at least until lock downs are over), more people with money problems, and so on. An chances are the best way the gov can save people from going into massive debt, a massive amount going bankrupt, and so on is by yet another round of checks TO EVERYONE like the last few times. Like the other possibilities is no checks which there is some likely to that, or maybe no lock downs which I seriously doubt will be a thing.

Point being, if we see another round of checks then we might see another massive pump in the market. So keep an eye on that. But if they don't come, lockdowns do end up happening, and other problems happen. We could see people pull money out of crypto to help feed their families.

I thought of creating a multi vendor marketplace platform which accepts cryptocurrency as a method of payment.

In this marketplace, there will be two types of vendors. 

**1. Vendors who accept cryptocurrency as payments.**

Here, when a customer purchases a product, the customer pays in a cryptocurrency which is accepted my vendor. The transaction is done between the customer and vendor. This way, there will be no middle man intervening the transaction.

**2. Vendors who accept fiat currency as payments.**

Here, when a customer purchases a product, the customer pays in cryptocurrency which is accepted by the platform. Once the periodic withdrawal date is reached, the cryptocurrency sales will be converted into fiat currency sale minus the commission to pay the vendor.

Note that I will be acting as third party mediator in this scenario. Fiat currency vendor withdrawals will be approved manually by me. 

The reason for introducing this second type of vendors is to attract more vendors. Such as Seller who already sell products on amazon or Ebay. These sellers will have comparatively lower marketplace commissions rates compared to Ebay and Amazon's \~10% As a result these sellers will help to create a network effect which platforms like OpenBazzar lack.

Let me know your thoughts about this idea. Initially I thought of using wordpress to create this marketplace website and integrate a thirst party crypto payment processor. Then I later realized that this approach will make the system centralized. I m still new to crypto, so I don't have much knowledge in creating Dapps. 

In the off chance where this idea is really good, I would invite you to team up with me so that we can make this vision a success. 

Thank you",CryptoCurrency,Ebay like marketplace that accepts both crypto and fiat,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r4okyz/ebay_like_marketplace_that_accepts_both_crypto/,True,submission

We are in this because of our ideologies, interests and/or simply money. But when things go sideways or up, emotions always get raw. Here is my personal take on especially the downside phases of Bitcoin regarding historical prices, focusing on the 2018 bear market bottom and the late 2019 bottom. With the given context that many bottoms and peaks are yet to come. 

2018 – Bitcoin tumbles to $3,100

One thing is clear. People can have different interpretations of what a bottom is. And what could be a universally accepted bottom is often not. And when we reached the absolute bottom in hindsight, people still feared a deeper plunge. And with “people” I don’t mean only the laymans people like we are, but also the professional investors. 

The thing is, that Bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies are relatively young and new tech/economical applications. When a subject gets hit in a growing state, it is bound to hit like a truck. The Bitcoin tumbling down from $11,000 to about $5,800 was not even the end of it. When it plunged down further with about 45% to $3,100, the general sentiment was at best gloomy. “The tech is worthless”, “Fiat money forever” and “I told you so”, all quotes we remember being said on media and even by our own family and friends. 

2019 – Bitcoin falls to $6,500

In 2019 the bear market ended and something incredible happened. Bitcoin went from $4k to $14k in just a couple of months. We all thought we were entering a hyper bull run, Facebook announced it’s then called Libra and we were shooting straight for the moon. But as a rollercoaster, that seemed like a peak you had to get down of. We went all the way down to $7k. A halving you might say. In value, that is. With some other news rumbling about big parties mentioning blockchain, the Bitcoin value began to soar again, and so did our emotions. “Is Bitcoin here to stay?”, “Company X said something positive about Bitcoin, bullish!”, and friends already making dinner appointments at restaurants for us to financially cover. 

Now 

The current value of Bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrency) right now doesn’t matter in the context of this thread. It might be up or down compared to when I started writing this. What I do know is that there are many bottoms and peaks yet to come. The general crowd naturally doubts new tech / applications and we are a part of the latter. Of course we too have our doubts from time to time. But remember the Apples and Facebooks, starting in their garage with no real future perspective at that time. We are in for a wild ride. 

**One day we will read this quote as said by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in history books**

""Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.""

Remember, we are at the beginning of this movement. There will be doubts and certainly some growing pains. But that is all part of the journey.

As the title said I'm planning to exchange $50 in crypto for $40 in cash. The reasons and explanation of why are actually pretty simple. Recently, I participated in a scavenger hunt hosted by FTX USA in which they gave everyone who was in the top 100 $50 in crypto. I completed the hunt several times with different accounts each. FTX USA plans to distribute the money via a person signing up for an FTX account with one of the winning emails and then distributing that money into their account. As you can only make one account per person I'm trying to sell the remaining emails here for below their actual value. I have 14 accounts available that I will be selling. I've attached some proof that I did in fact win the scavenger hunt below. Payment wise I'm hoping to send you an email and you simply venmo/zelle me the money. I'm open to negotiating the price so please PM about about it if you're interested.

 If anyone is interested please PM me and I'll send you a message about payment details. Please also PM me about any concerns you may have. Thank you.

I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

&amp;#x200B;

ChengPeng Zhao, Binance's founder gave an interview to 'Les Echos' a French Economy newspaper, here are the key points: 

&amp;#x200B;

* For him, crypto have changed: 

""Binance has seen their customer base jump from 20 millions to 85 millions this year. Since 2013 cryptos have gone forward thanks to more uses and applications (ICO, NFT Gamefi Sports token) on usages that can't be done in the traditional finance sector.""

&amp;#x200B;

* Advantages of being a big exchange:  

There are clearly advantages to operate a large platform. Binance's worldwide leadership (70% of the market in front Coinbase's 8%) allows us to invest hundreds of millions to get better infrastructures (securitiy efficiency  and customer services). Investing on a big platform is less risky and cheaper for an investor. 

&amp;#x200B;

*  About an European HQ;

 We started as a decentralized organization but we need to realize it is not seen on a keen eye by regulators. Our industry needs to be regulated and we are starting to create local, regional and worldwide headquarters. 

Our priorities are to get authorized to create Cryptos markets as there are not yet authorizations for these kind of activities, which means an authorization from each country. As soon as possible, France would be a natural choice for a regional or worldwide headquarters. We first need to get the PSAN authorization. 

* Small points: 

France regulator seems to have been welcoming 

Binance's 100 million investment in France will in part be done to create a research center for Blockchain tech 

They aren't scared of regulators

1470,OldFolksShawn,t2_125k45,1638165621,r4p0jd,71,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r4p0jd/lets_compare_bnb_cro_and_think_1_years_time/,1,"Right now lots of people are debating about which coin is the next big one. I mean every day we shill the coin we want to see succeed and make our bags grow. 

Currently there is a lot speculation on how big CRO will be and if they will become the next biggest thing in crypto. 

I want to look at a few different things, throw out some ideas, and put my 2 cents on what I am banking on for investment / financial growth. 

First, time shows us the ups and down of crypto. 

Jan of 2021 BNB was $40. It is used to pay for trades on its own exchange. If people were honest did they expect (not hope) that BNB would be sitting at $600 today?  Were they expecting a 15x return? In May when it topped out at $690 did they sell off as the market dipped? Happy to get whatever they could as the price went down? How long before people started being bullish on it again as it sat in that $300ish area for a while?

Seeing the current rise again what would most “project” it to rise to? Not “hope” but seeing the market, the new players in the crypto market and the addition of CRO. 

Why mention CRO now? We can talk again about the card they offer, the money back options, free spotify/netflix/etc as well as staking options. 

But what is it that they offer?

Apples to apples BNB and CRO both provide a platform to trade crypto. 

Crypto.com would be considered by many to be nothing special when compared to BNB until recently when they have exploded on the marketing scene.  Now the boards cannot go without constantly singing the praises of their marketing, being accessible to the average person, all the card benefits and more. 

This leads me to my second thought. 

What are we expecting and hoping for from CRO and its possible market price?

Imagine 1 year from now.  If it experienced the same growth as BNB the price would be $11.25. People will say but why not $200/$400/$600?

Obviously there is a difference in the circulating supply.  167mil vs 25Bil is no small difference. Trying to hit $200 per coin on a supply that large does seem impossible in a year. 

So lets play a fantasy game.  Lets ignore all the marketing hype. Lets ignore the “hopium”  Lets just say both see a 5x gain

So lets say you have $10,000 to invest. 
BNB $10,000 @ $600 a coin is 16.6 coins. When the price 5x you now have $49,800 yielding a profit of $39,800. 

CRO $10,000 @ .75 a coin is 13,333.3 coins. A 5x increase is $50,000.  Thus again a $40,000 profit. 

So neither coin created a “magical” gain. Both were equal in gains. 

The next questions are: Is $3000 per coin likely for BNB? Is $3.75 likely for CRO?

BNB is still below its all time high. CRO many would say has yet to really leave the gate in potential. 

So why is there so much hope for one and hate for the other?

I will say that a large majority of my bags have shifted to CRO because after DYOR I feel one has a higher chance of success in the long term. 

CRO I believe is the first crypto to really fire off the publicity cannons in an attempt to market itself to people of every financial spectrum.  Their PR team needs a bonus for the buzz they have created, securing the crypto.com page, going all in on marketing sports and more. 

It took me seeing a stupid add for coinbase over 50xs a while back before I finally said why not.  Now people watching basketball, F1 and more will see and hear that name and eventually many will say the same thing. 

So as next year is about to start, and many of our “hopes” of finding a coin to invest and diamond hold while it blasts off is on our mind I have found myself going all in on CRO.

[https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

As Victor Hugo said:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

I recently got ownership of [r/etica](https://www.reddit.com/r/etica/) and this is where I plan to organise the emerging community. If you are interested in this project make sure you join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/). It is the very very begining (as I'm writing there are only 5 members on [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/) haha).

**My brand new personal youtube channel where I mostly talk about Monero for now but I will start to also make videos about Etica:**

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

Finally, on Dec 31, 2019, the world realized the evils of centralized fiat currency, and every nation in the world announced they were shutting down their currencies, and BTC would be the only recognized legal tender, worldwide.

We will set aside the issue with everyone having only this fiat currency as their store of wealth, and that there would be no way to convert fiat to crypto, because no one is going to exchange something that has no worth for something of value, so just ignore that for now.

YOU DID IT!!!  YOU TOOK DOWN THE CENTRALIZED MONEY SYSTEM!  EVERYBODY GETS A LAMBO!  YOU GET A LAMBO, AND YOU GET A LAMBO AND YOU GET A LAMBO!  (Invoke Oprah in your head as you read).

Now, I'm sure everything is running smoothly, cuz without this fiat currency, everyone knows what 1 BTC is worth, right, because it's not like the value of BTC has been tied to how much fiat it can be sold for, for it's entire existence, right?

But, wait...oh no.  A pandemic hits.  Quarantine has been ordered in most countries, worldwide, and many people lose their jobs.  Most people in the industrialized world live paycheck to paycheck, and have little savings.

Currency is no longer centralized by the nations, or regions (in the case of the Euro and the EU), so these governments are unable to send money to their citizens, because they no longer create the money, which is now fixed in the total supply available, anyway.

What happens?

My belief is that in the case, more people die of poverty related causes, including suicide, than die from the disease of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking of joining [gate.io](https://gate.io) startups. But I'm not a VIP1 yet. Before sending GT to my account, I've made some observations.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

for example in 26/11/2021

&amp;#x200B;

there was CHEQ and MNY coins in startups.

&amp;#x200B;

20 USDT = 1470,5882 MNY

&amp;#x200B;

20 USDT = 250 CHEQ

&amp;#x200B;

When the sale begin in the first hour:

&amp;#x200B;

MNY raised until: 0.022 --- If I sell all of my MNY = 32,35 USDT --- Profit: 12,35 USDT

&amp;#x200B;

CHEQ: 0.4253 --- If I sell all = 106,32 USDT --- Profit: 86,32 USDT

&amp;#x200B;

Daily Profit: 98,67

&amp;#x200B;

in 25/11/2021

&amp;#x200B;

20 USDT = 26,6664 ICONS

&amp;#x200B;

20 USDT = 222.222 TRVL

&amp;#x200B;

In the first hour

&amp;#x200B;

ICONS raised until: 7,44 --- If I sell all = 198,39 USDT --- Profit: 178,39 USDT

&amp;#x200B;

TRVL raised until: 0.50 (it goes up in the second hour. But for this example I just look at the first hour) --- If I sell all = 111,111 USDT --- Profit: 91,111 USDT

&amp;#x200B;

Daily profit: 269,501

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So is this real? :) It seems to be too god. I mean it doesn't make you rich. But for daily income 100 - 200 USD is great for me.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

As Victor Hugo once said:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

I recently got ownership of [r/etica](https://www.reddit.com/r/etica/) and this is where I plan to organise the emerging community. If you are interested in this project make sure you join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/). It is the very very begining (as I'm writing there are only 5 members on [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/) haha).

**My brand new personal youtube channel where I mostly talk about Monero for now but I will start to also make videos about Etica:**

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

This stuff is not mine, it is all about building it together. Let's become Legends and Join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/)

Crypto currency is nothing other than the ghost and it have possessed people's mind
1. It is not backed by any fiat currency so doesn't have intrinsic value
2. Its a clear demand supply gap so prices are soaring up without any solid or stable backing.
3. No one knows what's the limit
4.technology is changing day by day and quantum computers are not far away.
Once a quantum computer comes into existence mining millions of coin in few minutes will be easy job
And Surplus supply of crypto will make it come to the ground.

Imagine you are a plebian in the days of way old...like 500 BC. You are most likely bartering your way through life...pelts, crops, sex, and the like! Then along comes Croesus of Lydia; this guy was one of the first to mint gold coins of equal weight, value and purity. Now you can demand gold for services and goods at a fair medium of exchange. As a result, the Kingship of Lydia crushes it...until they were conquered by the Persians that is! Nothing like a wiki link to support my claims....!&gt;!.1&gt;!.1&gt;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia#First\_coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia#First_coinage)

I can just imagine a bunch of Roman Centurion being like, ""Gold coins from Lydia, never happen...scam"".

Currency has evolved much over the centuries. The Medici family introduced portability of funds through paper. All of the sudden, you could walk from Rome to Paris with a piece of paper and redeem your funds in a totally different city. You no longer had to carry around the physical gold you owned. More legit link -&gt;  [The Medici Family - HISTORY](https://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/medici-family) . And this is the form we still know and are accustom to today... cash.

Enter crypto:

Early on, 500 BC, people were really hesitant to accept gold coinage. They knew pelts &amp; sex...that's it. No one trusted gold. It took time to introduce the populace to the value of gold. The same is true of crypto. The older generation that grew up on the greenback will eventually give way to the next generation of thinkers and decision makers.  And, frankly, we like crypto. If you don't believe me, watch this south park clip which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The end:

The decentralization of finance is good. It's good for you and it's good for me. In ancient times, you and I were too stupid to count our money, this is why banks existed. Now, hopefully, you can count and do basic arithmetic to absolve yourselves of the banks. They need you!   You do not need them!

I encourage you all to travel down the bankless path and become independent of the financial system that has tied you down for centuries. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.

Say I'm holding $10k in chainlink in my Celsius account and plan to hold it for at least 5 years (not worried about it dipping to less than $9 where I could potentially get margin called). Currently I'm making 3% in interest but I can essentially opt out of that 3% and instead take out a $2.5k loan on that chainlink with a 0% interest rate. If I have a steady stream of income (4k a month) to pay back the 0% interest loan over 36 months (I would pay it back once cyrpto starts rising again to new ATHs cuz I'd stop DCAing) and crypto is dipping rn and I believe the price will be higher in a month or two, why wouldn't I take the loan and buy Bitcoin or Ethereum with it? 

Only downside that I can think of is that if it ends up dipping lower than I missed out on a chance to DCA but I feel like it's a little greedy to want lower prices than what they currently are. 

TL;DR my logic is that I would be spending my money to buy crypto anyways by DCAing on my paydays, but why not take out a 0% interest loan on Celsius instead since crypto is dipping rn and I'd rather lock in the current prices",CryptoCurrency,Why wouldn't I take a 0% apy loan from Celsius?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r3xfjd/why_wouldnt_i_take_a_0_apy_loan_from_celsius/,True,submission

But downloaded coinbase and started doing their tutorials, 5$ in btc for new users, 20$ in learn-to-earn coins, 10$ of my own money.

I tend to sleep with my nugget in BTC, since it can lose a 1000$ and I've only lost like 8 cents.

Switched over to coinbase pro, but it's not so easy to transfer/convert crypto, however fees are less. 

Downloaded PI, I think the sentiment here, is if it makes any money ever, then I'm up...I'll push the button but im not holding my breath.

But that got me on how can I earn other crypto...real talk, Money is tight!!! Very tight. So I am trying to earn, not buy. Not the best method, I know, but I want to keep my foot in the door.

So in looking at earning options I ended up dL'ing Binance, and found some games thru Gamefi that allow you to earn crypto...which then required me to download Metafox, browser extension...Tried to push some money over to binanace, but there seems to be an underpinned fee of 7$ to trade between coinbase and binance. WTH?! Wanted to send some of my funds over there to allow me to purchase in to a game Cryptoblades...in hopes of earning and turning in game coins...eventually for crypto.

But at this point I now have 3 wallets, Metafox, Coinbase, and Binance. Trying to hustle on these earnings and keep the ball rolling...but the more ""earning"" sites I find, the more wallets are required...and if the exchange between wallets is going to be more than 1% what am I am even doing.

I plan to drop in 20$ into binance just to have options...binanace seems to talk to metafox pretty well...but I am hitting a wall of information that is too high to make sense of it.

And so far, turned my 35$ into 45$, but these last 24 hours hit pretty hard and I am back down to 40$ 

I'm not asking for advice, because I know....READ, but I am not shunning the freely given advice either. Its been a mind blowing 3 weeks...but I am learning alot and kinda having fun...I mean 10 of my own dollars....is now 40$ Woot woot.",CryptoCurrency,Tales from a new guy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r3xh01/tales_from_a_new_guy/,True,submission

But by paying the 0.2 ETH you sign a smart contract that gives U2E-FREE a permission to withdraw all your money at any point.

When you purchase a coin with another coin in your wallet it says 0% fee (on Coinbase and Crypto.com) but it’s seems as though my account drops immediately after the trade.

I have been using only Brave for about 5 months now. I have my Brave News section setup to only show me crypto related news (which i love being able to do). I don't know why, but for some reason i felt like the Brave Ads/News were somewhat safer to browse. I'm pretty certain that this is not the case. I love Brave (best browser to-date), not their fault since anyone can pay to get an ad or news up.

One of the news blocks on my feed showed this cloud mining ish service with high gains. With me being a miner, i decided to take a gander and see what they were offering. 

They essentially offer high returns on coin investments with what seems like quick payouts. Initially, i was like ""holy shit you could make a lot doing this"". As soon as that thought hit, a chat box opened in the bottom-right of my screen. 

They immediately started spamming me with all this information about how great their service is and how i can pay. This was the largest red flag i have ever seen. Waving in the wind and all; it held a mighty presence.

I started to question why any legit service would spam me like that. My thought was ""isn't the website's purpose to provide me this info? Shouldnt the site be speaking for itself?""

Looking around the website with the ""is this a scam"" glasses equiped, paints a very clear picture. The service in my opinion is 100% a scam. I have no proof and have not used it, but it certainly looks like one. (Not giving details as i don't want to inadvertently help the scammers) just really look at that site.

This message goes out just to shine light on it. There might be someone out there who is unaware. So i am at least doing my due diligence and speaking up even if it's already widely known. If i am wrong, please do let me know.

To address this problem, of course, the supply of Bitcoin is capped, with a predetermined speed. This took away any influence of centralized parties on monetary policy. The allocation of supply is also done in a rule based way - through mining. This allowed anyone to participate in the distribution of increase supply. 

But both of these features come with their own set of problems: 

1. As the supply is limited and incremental supply is exponentially dropping, people started hodling BTC rather than using it for economic activity. 

2. As the distribution is linked to proof of work, the whole system became energy inefficient. 

The second point is a technical aspect of the network and there has been much discussion/arguments about it. So I will not get into this aspect any further. But point one remains a thorny issue as the main use of currency being a medium of exchange is not being served. One might come back and say BTC isa store of value - but the value has to come from something in the future. As it does not give any dividends, the value has to come from future utility as a medium of exchange. But that may not happen if incremental supply keeps dropping. 

Most other currencies that cloned BTC or developed their policies inspired by BTC keep the supply limited and have the same drawback as that of BTC. Thus there is a need for a new currency that has stable value with respect to real goods and commodities so that it can be used as unit of accounting. At the same time it should be available in plenty so that it is hodled but is held to be used as a medium of exchange. And ideally the underlying blockchain should be energy efficient.

Why would i want it?

Simple , so you can ape for new tokens as soon as it is possible. Of course 99% tokens are scams but there are some hidden gems in that 1% sometimes. Everybody knows twitter accounts that promote tokens howerer when they do that it's usually too late to ape in those tokens, this script will allow you to be one step before them. Just DYOR for token and watch as marketcap grow 10x,100x or even 1000x.

Is it safe ?

Yeah , script doesn't require any keys or seed or anything , it gets everything from BSC public node and doesn't interact with any wallet. You decide if you want to invest or not.

It's still work in progress but it work as intended. Also it can save tokens info to file so you can review everything later.

You can get it on my github:

So I’ve been using my CDC DeFi wallet’s earn feature to stake my Cro and get pretty good returns 

Today I checked and I see they are offering USDC with rates up to 46%
Usually most of the stable coins are right around 5-15% 

Most things in life that are too good to be true usually are, however I have seen some guys on here that get upwards of 20% returns in their stable coins using Blockfi or compound.

Can anyone provide any insight on this? I’d rather not make a second post in a day detailing how my wallet is now empty by a Nigerian princess 😂

So one of my siblings just jumped into crypto recently and she was introduced to Royal Q by someone from one of her crypto Telegram groups.

But what worries me the most is how enthusiastic she is about recruiting people. I admire her ecstasy for discovering the crypto world, but DYOR is not her strong quality and learning TA is not one of her interests. She is the ""hey people say this is good, so this must be good!""
  
I am somewhat tired to watch over her that sometimes I wouldn't mind if she learned something the hard way. Ah I love her too much that I hate how gullible she is.
  
As I never use any bot before (thinking to try), I don't really know how to react. Bot supposed to make her sleep well but, she is now glued to her phone all the time.

Something with protein or some grains are some good items to store. I still have to do some research on which items to buy. 

Buying random items which have little utility and that cannot be sold due to lack of buyers would not make sense. So I have to see what is needed the most. Which items in the dollar store would be worthy of purchasing while maintaining its value?

Finding a safe place to store the items would be the hard part.

Just looking for CEX recommdations to get my hands early on those altcoin gems. 

I know KuCoin is kind of the go-to exchange for new coins and tokens, but they don't like the color of my ID documents 😉 Hence, they denied me service and support when I applied for KYC. Maybe my account is still ""active"", but I don't want to use it. Don't want my withdrawals stuck with them unless I clear KYC, which I clearly can't. 

So, if you use a another CEX to get into a new project, please recommend. A quick Google search gives me Gate.io, Ascendex, Bitmart, Bitfinex, and a few others. But I want to read about your experience with an exchange that you use. Fees are a factor, but the most important consideration for me is the exchange's attitude towards KYC - whether it allows trading and withdrawals even without KYC; and of course, their tendency to list new projects. 

I mainly use Binance but they're pretty slow at listing new projects. By the time a token reaches Binance, it's already way oversold to ape into.

PS: Buying new BSC projects isn't an issue thanks to PCS. My main pain point is buying tokens on Ethereum without paying the horrendous gas fees.

Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company’s stock — or, in the case of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, of all the coins that have been mined. In crypto, market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have been mined by the price of a single coin at any given time.

One way to think about market cap is as a rough gauge for how stable an asset is likely to be. (It’s important to note that even Bitcoin, crypto’s biggest market cap, still sees volatility.) But the same way a bigger ship can safely navigate heavy weather, a cryptocurrency with a much larger market cap is more likely to be a more stable investment than one with a much smaller market cap. Conversely digital currencies with smaller market caps are more susceptible to the whims of the market – and can see huge gains or dramatic losses in their wake.  

Sidenote: you might see references to “circulating supply” market cap or “fully diluted supply” market cap. With Bitcoin, those two numbers are the 18.5 million that have been mined (“circulating supply”) or you can use the 21 million that will eventually be mined (“fully diluted supply). Depending on their methodology, some observers will measure market cap using the currently circulating supply, while others will use the fully diluted number.

I believe this is very accurate. It has also already shown to be one of, if not, the best performing asset of all time. Here is why Bitcoin could reach 400k using just numbers, and as we should all know, women lie, men lie, numbers don’t. 

Bitcoin has a fixed supply of ONLY 21 million. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. Each bitcoin is also highly fractionalized, since conception, by design, using satoshis. This will prove to possibly be the most genius foresight by Bitcoin of all. I will explain why later. 

Right now Bitcoin is trading around $54,500. The market cap is 1 trillion dollars. This means 1 trillion dollars is currently parked in X bitcoin (1 trillion / 54,500 = X). X equals the number of coins in existence storing that trillion. 1 trillion divided by 54,500 indicates the supply is currently sitting around roughly 18,348,623.853211 bitcoin. That is roughly 18.5 million coins. This lines up nearly precisely with the current amount believed to have been mined thus far. Now let’s assume that someday all 21 million bitcoin will be in circulation, so the money would then be split evenly between 21 million. 

With 1 trillion dollars currently sitting in about 18.5 million bitcoin, that 18.5 million can only grow to 21 million. When there are all 21 million in circulation, and no other bitcoin can be added to the supply, any inflow of capital can only mean ONE thing. The inflowing money will HAVE to be stored equally between the only 21 million coins there are. Meaning the coins will inevitably RISE in value because there is no where else to store the money. 

Let’s say a trillion dollars gets added right now to bitcoin, that trillion will flow directly into the 18.5 million raising the price 100%. 

So if 2 trillion was parked in btc right now, mind you there are only about 18.5 million right now, the price would be double what it currently is. $109,000 (54,500 x 2 = $ 109,000). 

Bitcoin is only 12-13 years old. It only has 1 trillion stored in it thus far. Institutional money has largely withheld from entering. As corrupt governments and global lying national leaders continue to continuously print money, devaluing every fiat dollar you currently have, people will increasingly look for ways to ensure their money won’t lose value by a rigged system completely out of their hands. 

Bitcoin on the other hand won’t ever add any to the supply. There will never be any additional bitcoin printed. Bitcoin will never behave like a corrupt government with wanton disregard for the effects of it’s actions on its investors. Bitcoin was created altruistically as a way for every human being to escape a rigged system run by uncontrollable, unstoppable, and unethical governments.

The question becomes, just how many trillions will be stored in Bitcoin someday? 4 trillion? 6 trillion? 10 trillion? 

If 10 trillion is someday stored in 21 million bitcoin, which is 10x the trillion currently in there, the price will be about $476,190 dollars per btc. This is VERY possible especially considering currents events all over the world. 

To top it off, by it being so fractionalized using satoshis as mentioned before, even with a 500 k price per BTC, satoshis will ALWAYS be available to the poorest investors there are. Using no more than $2-3 someone will still be able to own a few satoshis even when bitcoin is 500 k. 

This is genius and integral because it means no private entity can swoop in and split bitcoin up any further to make it more accessible to the retail investor. It will ALWAYS be.

So, today is Thanksgiving here in the U.S. and there are any number of things people are grateful for . Me personally, I'm thankful for having a job, a loving family, and overall good health. However, there's people out there that don't celebrate it, so I figured I'd just pen a bit of an ode to Thanksgiving but with crypto themes to it.

Today is Thanksgiving and we all come to see, 
Some gains that are plenty for both you and me.
There's Bitcoin and Eth, Doge and Shib too, 
And let's not forget about other Inus.


The market goes up, and the market goes down, 
Bitcoin is King, but is one with no crown.
There's turkeys and rug pulls, and scams are a plenty, 
But sometimes it's fun just to watch and be ready.
Buy the dip, because dip tastes so good, 
Then sell when it's high, to stop chopping that wood. 
We work and we grind for our meager paychecks., Some people are all in on that one.. oh yeah, WHEX.
Cardano is wild and Algorand is cheap,
Time to buy some before it reaches its peak.

The first thing I want to note is that some of this information may be **old news** for those of you who have been here a while. However, we have a lot of new members and I wanted to lend some of my experience and screenshots of receiving messages from scammers in order to give them the advantage **when** (not if) it happens to them. 

I, like many of you, have received many messages all over my social media accounts. Many of these messages harbour blatant criminal intent, while others it's hard to be sure. Now, by all means, this post is not proclaiming that **all messages from strangers are intent on stealing your crypto,** but a majority of them are and it is often better practice to be critical and wary. 

First things first, newcomers here, once you start being more active in the community, people might get ahold of your Twitter handle, Facebook account, Reddit account, or even WhatsApp, and you will be messaged. Now, this is no reason to be alarmed. Unless you have posted your holdings **(never do this)** and thrown in all your contact information, the likeliness a scammer is reaching out to you **because** they know you have a huge bag is unlikely. Most of these scam attempts are scattershot attempts. They have a simple structure and they send those messages around to thousands of accounts a day like clockwork.

Here is one for example: 

[Common scam message #1](https://preview.redd.it/m4bieuwb5v181.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f12c69dc84e1ce507ea7e8173f22c0d0672c1b54)

This is a message on WhatsApp from a random number. These messages can come from anywhere and will often be worded in a similar vein. They prey on the **lack of knowledge** of newcomers by offering free advice, communities, or even enticing opportunities to double, triple, or 100x your money. **These kinds of messages are 99.9% scams.** Now, don't get me wrong, communities are great, but this is not the way to go about finding them. 

My next example is a more lengthy one. Often real people, rather than automated or c&amp;p messages, might reach out to you. They specifically prey on those who are new to the field and not knowledgeable regarding how to protect their assets and information. The people might reach out to you looking like a professional business person, a cute girl, or some other individual who makes you feel they warrant a response. Their profiles might look like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

[A Sus. Profile of a Random Messenger ](https://preview.redd.it/b4p0cjsa6v181.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70df8cea57f399856235cb0ae52b1dca2f4c08de)

**Now again, I am not promoting antisocialism... Be sure to connect, meet people, and form relationships. They make this bumpy crypto ride all the more fun.** However, scammers are not out to teach you, console you, or give you any pointers on what to get your mother-in-law for Christmas, they are out for your assets, plain and simple. 

So, I received a message and it looked like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Scammer Message 1](https://preview.redd.it/wube0jot6v181.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeae188fe3a305fea1cb4328c6d4eaf91366b620)

These guys message people all day long. The beginning of the convo often starts quite error-free (grammar-wise) but later on you can start to see the holes if you poke and prod. 

Nevertheless, it's hard to ignore a seemingly beautiful woman thinking you are her Jimmy. So, it's all good, with something like this, no need to jump straight to, ""Hey! Hands of my Bitcoins!"" Instead, just take mental notes of things that seem off and accumulate them throughout the conversation to determine whether the sender is a friend or foe. (My ratio is often 1 innocent random messenger: 9 foes) 

And so the convo ensued: 

[Scammer Message 2](https://preview.redd.it/zgfj37hn7v181.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aee7f503ad287a4855ecc2531f4e114e9757e4c3)

Small talk continues... Can't shoot the chance that she actually might be who she says she is down just yet. But as mentioned before, some things should start to set off alarms in your mind. Best to be skeptical, but no need to be hostile. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Scammer Message 3](https://preview.redd.it/7df1d7758v181.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef53e64f32b9172333d32b9dad058a2de8c062df)

Now we struck the alarm... What kind of business explanation is this? This is reminding me of those scam emails now. Cmon people, let's get a little more original! Jokes aside, let's get into analysis mode here. ""She,"" says a lot in this paragraph but it really just sums up to nothing. Note: usually when you ask odd questions to these kinds of scammers they often break down in their ability to respond intuitively. Remember, you're working with people who can't get two brain cells together to make their own crypto gains, resulting in the fact that they have to steal them from other people. So, right away this response should set off all flags and alarms for whoever receives it because no chance in hell is a pretty lady, who happens to have an uncle as the chief analyst at Goldman Sachs, telling me about the fact that she is dabbling in cryptocurrency... wtf? 

So I took the bait..... for .... uh... Science. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Scammer Message 4](https://preview.redd.it/zldg67xb9v181.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec6936f8f8b926bb14b1ad2d17ed748e4d1625a)

So in this instance, I played it off as I took the bait and believed the scammer was the niece of some top analyst at Goldman Sachs. However, to put the fist down on this conversation, I explained clearly the type of scams in crypto to look out for... like I am down now. The purpose of this is to get the messenger to realize: **A) I am not going to waste my time anymore and end convo.**.. or **B) I am going to be grateful because I am not a scammer**... *Most scammers will be deterred by this because cracking a security-conscious hodler is way too much work for these people.* So this tactic works quite well in most cases. See the above and below photo for my response: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Scammer Message 5](https://preview.redd.it/v5ibzmt9bv181.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210bfc74c27d6dec5d84a6c597e8127210cc5f6d)

And soooo..... They left--never to log on to that account since Nov 15th, 2021. That's how you give the ultimatum without possibly ruining the opportunity for connection if you do happen to actually connect with a real non-bloodsucking human being. 

**Recap:** 

\- Building connections with others in the crypto world is great. However, be wary. There are just as many scammers out there as there are genuine, caring crypto-pals. However, because we seldom reach out to each other via messaging, your primary stance should always be cautious skepticism when receiving messages like these. 

**Tips:** 

\- *Don't share your holdings online.*

*- Don't post your personal information when you are online chatting about crypto.* 

*- Don't click on links when they come in the forms we mentioned above.* 

*- Don't share your passwords, seed phrases, or any other account information with anyone online. No rep, customer service, or community member needs those things to help you with anything* ***ever.*** 

*- When receiving these kinds of messages from real people, be kind and deter them by showing off your crypto-security skills!*

Today I stumbled across what I believe to be a scam on Twitter. 

My experience started when I recieved a Twitter notification, initially I was elated that someone might actually be talking to me, but alas, it was just a tweet notification from a page I had never heard of before. It said something like: 

“Drop your ETH address, don’t ask why! 🙈”

Right away this got me jacked because I know that coins can be dropped into a wallet, and once touched said coins drain  your wallet of legitimate coins. It’s a pretty well known scam. Red flag no.1

Looking at the page, it appeared to be a Cardano spin-off coin. Red flag no.2 

Looking at the page itself: 
- It had 22k followers. 
- It had comments on posts.
- It had post likes. 

Which technically should have been a green flag right? I mean, it’s ‘WeLl KnOwN’ others are using it, a scam can’t fool ThAt ManY pEople… right? 

WRONG. 

You can BUY followers. You can buy page likes and seemingly genuine interactions. Page followers/post likes are NOT an indication of legitimacy. Still, it’s possible it’s just a new project as well.. so, we’ll give that a yellow flag so as not to stigmatise legitimate new projects. 

Moving on I then turned my keen powers of perception to the listed website. Honestly it looked pretty alright, nice smooth lay out, fancy motion background, about page and project team page. Good good. 
However, reading through it, goal statements were flimsy at best, it didn’t really even seem to have a goal or use. I went to the team page. Names of people are listed, but the photos of the team appear to be drawn/cartoon filtered. Quick google search of team names you get people who look completely different with careers like: song writer, actor, fictional character - I shit you not. Red flag 100%

Finally, I checked token sniffer. Using the address listed on their own website the token scored a whooping 15/100 for the automated audit. Final nail in the coffin as far as I’m concerned. 

The sad part about all of this is that looking through the page you can see people commenting how they sent ETH and didn’t receive any of the new vAlUeabLe token. Or asking why they’re sending their own wallet address. 

So people, please please remember likes, followers, even comments CAN AND WILL BE BOUGHT to make scams appear more legitimate. Always double, triple check everything and when you get that tingle of ‘should I really be doing this, it seems sketchy?’ - trust that feeling. No one is giving you anything for free. Don’t fall for it. Don’t give your address out publicly to strangers for one thing. Also don’t buy coins that you know in your gut seem dodgey.

Scams in crypto are so disheartening because they use the names of legitimate coins to scam, this creates a general distrust for crypto and makes mass adoption of crypto just that but harder.

So from what I can see there is capital gains tax free allowance which stands at £12,300 according too HMRCs website.

What I can't seem to find out is if this tax free allowance is separate from the £12,570 tax free allowance we get when we pay standard income tax?

Is the gains I make from crypto deductable from the income tax free allowance or is capital gains completely separate?

Also, I can't seem to find out if we still need to even declare our gains when it's made under the capital gains tax free allowance.

Similar to how, if you're self employed, you can earn roughly £1000 before you even need to bother telling HMRC about the money you've made.

I sold some crypto for fiat a couple months ago when I was strapped for cash (not even sure if I sold at a profit) and I don't know if i NEED to tell HMRC about it. If I made any gains at all it's well under this supposed ""£12,000 tax free allowance"" so I'd be fucking stoked if I don't even need to bother declaring it.

Part of me is thinking about winging it and not saying anything and hoping I don't investigated. But one thing the government is good at is collecting taxes so that's why I'm here trying to find out more information on how I owe them possible tax.

This may be helpful to those that are new or a good reminder for those that are veterans to crypto trading.

1. **Create an investment plan**. *“If You Fail to Plan, You Are Planning to Fail” — Benjamin Franklin.* Ask yourself how much you want to invest, when to invest, set a goal, and determine what amount you’d be comfortable selling at (if you plan to sell at all). To get started, consider investing on a schedule (every paycheck, once a week, once a month). A little can go a long way. Consider taxes and exchange fees when planning, too.
2. **Stick to your ticket**. *You're a crypto investor, Harry...* Your plan will protect you from loss and set you up for gain. If you buy in at a certain price, following your plan, have patience until it’s profitable. Don’t sell early. Wait until you’ve netted some profits. Look to your peers for support if you’re doubting. If one thing is predictable in this market, it’s that prices/value usually go up, eventually. That’s why so many people say buy and HODL (hold, don’t sell). It may take months; it may take years, but in general, in the grand scheme of things, this technology is just getting started.
3. **Expect a loss in the short term, and a gain in the long term**. *“A winning strategy must include losing.” —* *Robert T. Kiyosaki**.* If it goes up after you buy, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. If you’re confident in what you’d like to invest in, because you’ve done the research, think of it like a CD at a bank or maybe even a 401k. Both have fees, taxes, or penalties for withdrawing early. Consider your money locked away for a period of time. If the price goes down by 1%, 5%, or even up to 50%, that’s just the fee for taking your money out early. It’s more than likely that your investment will go up with time, if you’ve carefully looked at what you’re investing in and you believe in it.
4. **Don’t bet your whole stack on a single trade**. *This isn't a game of green light, red light.* When buying in, set multiple buy-in points. For example, if you do your own research, and you are relatively certain the price will go up in the short term, don’t buy in with all of your cash. You’ll want to keep a percentage of your cash to buy in if it goes lower than you’d expect. Average your buy in points and sell off points across a range that you’re comfortable with.
5. **Look for when your coin/token is on sale**. *""I bought the dip, but it keeps dipping!""* If you invest in a cryptocurrency and the price goes down, consider it to be on sale, and try to buy more.
6. **Learn from other’s failures, and don’t take out loans to invest**. *“Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.” ― Eleanor Roosevelt.* Many people I know invested in Bitcoin in Dec 2017 (when the price of Bitcoin was rising). I heard stories of some (friends of friends) that took out a loan for cash to invest. They bought in when the market was on the rise, and held ‘til it crashed. Then, they lost faith and sold. They took their money out early and ended up in a bad situation.
7. **There** ***is*** **such a thing as too much risk**. *One does not simply bet what they can't lose.* Be careful and consider all of the potential consequences if you are thinking about investing money you’re worried about losing. 
8. **Don’t let your emotions decide when to sell or buy**. *""You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind."" — Morpheus, The Matrix.* Manage your fear of missing out (FOMO); don’t buy just because the price is going up. If you do this, you’ll often buy at a high and lose money. Watch out for fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD); don’t sell just because the price is going down and you get scared. If you do this, you’ll often sell at a low, just before the price is about to rise. Keep in mind that a few percentage points up and down throughout a day is normal. Calculate what this is so that you expect it. It could be in the hundreds or thousands based on how much you invest.
9. **Get to know the tools of the trade**. ""*The best investment is in the tools of one’s own trade."" — Benjamin Franklin.* Research which exchanges are right for you, not just what your friend or family member recommended. Understand what fees are involved for trades. Don’t hesitate to try a few different exchanges. Consider learning about limit orders; they’ll help you in the long run. Learn about wallets and staking, if applicable to your trading plan. Make sure you understand what taxes you will need to pay on any capital gains; know that there are cryptocurrency tax services out there that can help.
10. **Beware of scammers**. This is perhaps the most important!! If anyone messages you about cryptocurrency, be skeptical of their intent. Research all exchanges and wallets that you’re considering thoroughly; don’t just click the first link that pops up on a search. Be careful about installing ANY software or mobile apps. Lookup independent reviews first.

I hope these guidelines or tips are helpful. I really have this community to thank for much of the knowledge I’ve gained. Thank you!

Also, note, none of this is financial advice. I’m not qualified to advise anyone on this stuff; just learning - sometimes the hard way, like everyone else.

It is easy and I'm sure the first hit you get when you type in crypto on google or close to it. The name is every where now with commercials featuring Matt Damon, on the Staple Center building now after getting the naming right, and sponsoring a F1 car. Let's take all that away for a minute because no one is going to argue the bullish part of it on that alone.

So I'm pretty much a noob when it comes to TA, so I actually want some help with this part to see if it's actually a legit good coin besides from that above. My first comp for it in Binance Coin since it's an exchange coin as well and has done remarkably well. When comparing them though, I do see some things that concern me, but maybe I shouldn't be.

Is BNB actually a good comp for it? If so, No max supply listed, far less liquidity available, 151x more total supply. My original thought when thinking of investing was ""could CRO ever get to the price target BNB is at?"" especially since if Live Coin Watch is right, BNB was as low at $0.10 at one point. My worry though is with so little liquidity available in comparison, no max supply would make it inflationary wouldn't it? If they do run out, wouldn't they just make more and drive the price down? If so what can we realistically see long term? That said I invested in it and was thinking of doing more before looking into it more. What am I missing outside of the hype, good name, and advertising of it? Like I said I am new to this and try to stick to blue chips, but also don't want to miss out if this would actually be a good long term play.",CryptoCurrency,"Advertising and Naming out of it, can we discuss CRO as a token itself",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1o9nx/advertising_and_naming_out_of_it_can_we_discuss/,True,submission

They seem to have targeted international partners in government and institutions rather than VCs, Exchanges and traders 

On his recent Africa tour Charles didnt go to sell Cardano to the average person on the street. He went to convince governments and institutions that the Cardano Foundation and its partners will offer all the services. 

They built a monopolistic DAPP platform focused on potential centralized oversight. With a decentralised consensus mechanism. They did this by making ADA  DAPP building as complicated as possible but staking as simplistic as possible 

In all honesty from the looks of it they don't care if people trade their token or pump their bags at this point. They are up nearly 100x and can bleed to $0.20 and still be in profit. They want to have government contracts not listed on exchanges 

SOL is the complete opposite of ADA. Linked to FTX;  has 89% of its tokens held by investors and VCs. Had a massive marketing campaign including influencer partnerships.

Most other exchanges show a price that is within a millionth of a cent from each other while crypto.com shows a price that's a couple hundred thousandths different. They are all converting to USD, all set to the same time zone, refresh rate and so on.

Also, while looking at my wallet on the crypto.com app, it will show my balance for a particular coin is (for example)  $450.50. If I go to sell, the price it gives is always along the lines of $430.10. I understand that isn't much of a difference, but the sale information will say that there were zero fees charged so I'm curious why there's such a difference. If it were less of a difference I might believe that it's simply the price change in the 5 or so seconds it took me to make the sale, but I don't believe that's it. The fact that it never gives me a higher price than the price I started the sale at also makes me feel like this isn't the answer. 

Like I said, I'm fairly new to crypto and I'm just trying to understand these little (and I know minor) differences. Any information is appreciated.

I invest my own time and money in crypto. I have a nagging thought that I am hoping someone in the community can help me with.

Discussion point: There are many interesting projects underway with valuable use cases in place and technology that is driving progression in the crypto space. However, I am concerned that everyone still “thinks” in fiat. When I hear people describe their holdings, the value of those holdings is always (or nearly always) described in the native currency (US dollars, for example). People say they have $60,000 of Ethereum, not 1 BTC of Ethereum. When you open wallets and want to see the value of your portfolio, you see it described in fiat. Everything describing cryptocurrency value uses a fiat currency as its baseline, and that is even among the businesses and individuals with a heavy stake in crypto. I can’t help but feel like that is crypto’s biggest vulnerability and I am struggling with understanding the path forward that allows that to change.

In order for that change to occur, I would imagine that goods and services would need to be provided in exchange for crypto directly. However, for that to happen, there would need to be a collective mindset shift to re-baseline to crypto. If the baseline is still a fiat currency, then those who are skeptical will be hesitant to accept payment in crypto, and those who believe it will continue to increase in value will be reluctant to part with it due to the speculation of future value in fiat currency. In this case, I see the HODL mentality as being detrimental to crypto’s success.

I used the word “think” because I liken it to speaking a new language. You will learn a new language best and start to think in that language when immersed in it for a period of time. I am concerned that we haven’t immersed ourselves enough in crypto for it to achieve ultimate success because we still perceive its underlying value in terms of fiat currencies.

For example: have you heard of CRO? The Crypto.com coin? Build a liquidity pair (LP) with ATOM on the Osmosis dex and you’re getting 65% APR.

Heard of LUNA? Couple that with ATOM and you have a 41% return.

Do you need a VPN? So happens there is a VPN called Sentinel on the ATOM network (available on Android, launching soon for iPhone and desktop soon) that has a 148% APR with ATOM. 

There are like 30 pools for you to choose from, tons of amazing projects with more coming (including SCRT, which will provide privacy to the entire ATOM ecosystem). I know when you open the coinbase app, 10% on ATOM seems great compared to ADA and XTZ, but there is so much more available to you if you put in a little more effort. Check it out:

For example, I know AVAX (11), LTC (15), and UNI (17) have utility uses such as Dapps. I [read](https://financefeeds.com/avalanches-fast-growth-challenges-ethereums-long-standing-defi-dominance/) that Avalanche has growing Dapps like the Pangolin DEX and [Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/02/04/what-is-uniswap-a-complete-beginners-guide/) is also a DEX. 

But what about DOGE or SHIBA? Or even memecoins? Or do people stake in the coins and then just sell when it reaches ATH?

It was one of those whatsapp scams where some random beautiful girl from Hong Kong messaging you thinking you were some one else. I never realized something like this happens. Nonetheless, she helped me invest in bitcoin and helped me made profit. I invested around 9500 CAD which are currently at 25K CAD. I was using Shakepay to buy and then sending the bitcoin to an app called coinyee. She taught me how I can take the money out and transfer it to my account but the transaction froze and the customer care told me that I have to first pay taxes on the amount that equates to 7500 CAD approx. I am sure this is a scam but they are also not able to use that money on the account because I have the login credentials. Is there any way I can get that amount back. Should I add that money and will, the transaction be successful or is this the last part of the scam where the money I add will be lost forever along with the money there as well.

I’m sure many of us would say, **“well I’d buy Monero”**, But then what? How would you spend it, trade with it or swap it for fiat in a world where only Fiat currency is legal to hold, spend, etc.

Ideally in such a scenario, if you want to hold and trade cryptocurrencies to generate an income of some kind as well as live off of it (spend some of it), a few criteria must be satisfied. 

1. A privacy coin needs to be able to either, be able to be traded against other privacy coins, or against on chain pegs of assets or other coins such as Mirror or Synthetix protocol. Basically such a protocol would have to exist on a chain like Monero.

2. This privacy coin needs to also be able to be covertly spent. The only way to do this without the suspicion of banks, is to firstly be able to swap to Fiat via some kind of covert DEX such as Bisq but perhaps more secure. Secondly is to launder your fiat swaps through a company you own, and either pay yourself or write your expenses off on your company as some kind of glorified CEO compensation package.

This is why my question was not so simple after all. So. Given these criteria are not easily fulfilled, what’s your plan?

Executives began embracing BTC back in August 2020 — and told Markets Insider that they're up 460% on their initial investment. Back then, a single Bitcoin was valued at about $12,000.

(DISCLAIMER: I'll eventually tell you, and offer proof.  But to discover evidence, you'll have to work, because providing links will automatically delete this post.  So please keep an extra browser window open, to keep me honest!)

Imagine a coin that is completely decentralized; every token in existence is owned and controlled by the Community that supports it. The supply is fixed. No more coins can ever be created; the minting keys are burnt. As a result, the price can't be controlled by developers, or a foundation, or a vesting schedule, or some sort of computer algorithm; instead, intrinsic value is determined by old-fashioned economics - supply and demand. It would have to be cheaper than bitcoin and faster than ethereum; in fact, it would have to be demonstrably better than any other top ten coin. In summary, it would be the purest, fastest, cheapest, most-democratic medium of exchange the world has ever known, and it would be all that right now - in the year 2021.

Now, the problem with such a cyrptocurrency is no one would actively develop it; there's no fiduciary interest in simply creating coins, then releasing them. No one ever got rich, or even kept their job, by wasting resources. But what if the special circumstances of a black-swan event compelled the developers to make decisions they wouldn't normally make?

Well, they did.

And what if those decisions inadvertently created a coin with no owner, no foundation or governing body, no one who could or would manipulate the price?

They did that too.

Don't only the harshest circumstances, the most severe, acute conditions, typically create the purest, rarest, most beautiful objects on earth?

They did, and they do, because the cryptocurrency TITAN is as pure, rare, and beautiful as a diamond.

It's a completely decentralized, entirely vested, fixed supply coin that runs on the Polygon Network, so it's cheap, fast, and reliable. Originally developed by Iron Finance as part of their collaterized stablecoin project, its value crashed from $64 to $.00000002 in ONE DAY after some sort of ""bankrun"" occurred in decentralized finance. In a marketplace accustomed to drama and uncertainty, it was possibly the most dramatic, most catastrophic collapse in the short history of cryptocurrency:

*google:* ""finematics bank run de-fi""

As a result of this collapse, Iron Finance severed their relationship with TITAN forever, determined to start again. They renounced ownership of the coin, and burned the minting keys.

*google:* ""twitter iron finance renounced ownership""

They simply abandoned it, let it go. And now it simply exists - as big, wild, and free as the most ardent cyberpunk's dream. It's an outlier, exceptional not for what it once was, but for what it has become. And that's the most fundamentally perfect form of democratic cryptocurrency the world has ever seen.

Don't believe me? Let's compare:

Dogecoin - Elon Musk's darling - has UNLIMITED supply. Literally, INFINITE! A guy I know once said using DOGE was like trying to mop a floor using a bucket that never stopped leaking. I'm still amazed it's holding steady around $.20.

*google:* ""fool 5 reasons dogecoin""

Ripple developers will drop millions on your head:

*This one's sort of specific, and there's lots here, because of the current court case, but this should get you started.  google:* ""xrptalk topic/2629 selling my xrp""

Nobody knows how many ethereum there are, or ever will be:

*google:* ""bitrates how many ethereum""

Cardano has a fixed supply, but only two-thirds is circulating. Why does that matter? Because no one knows the future, and you never know if some later change will somehow dump the other third:

*google:* ""gfinityesports cardano supply""

I refuse to discuss either Tether USDT or Binance Coin BNB. If you don't realize those coins are garbage, you shouldn't be reading this.  Wait.....hold up - I can't resist:

*google:* ""BSC lost cause""

But let's keep going.....How about Polkadot? It's new, fancy, and complicated, right? Well, it also has UNLIMITED supply:

*google:* ""support polkadot total supply""

How about some other coins? How about NEO or IOTA? Nope:

*google:* ""bitcoin.com cryptocurrencies centralized""

What about a memecoin, like Shiba Inu - the ""Dogecoin Killer""? Would you want the value of a financial investment determined by a marketing stunt?

*google:* ""vitaliks regift""

How about KIN? Ever heard of it? I hesitate including it here because I'm a KIN guy. Read my other posts and you'll see why. Basically, I like it because the developers bested the SEC in a court battle, and it can never be considered a security:

*google:* ""horizons law kin""

But they're having some issues migrating blockchains, and their foundation has been accused of distributing Community rewards to developers who don't deserve them:

*google:* ""kinfoundation psiphon pro""

The only cryptocurrency I've found that could conceivably compete with TITAN is Digital Reserve Currency- DRC. The supply is fixed and completely vested; the tokens are indivisible. No one runs it; there’s no one’s in charge. That makes it possible to pass the Howey Test. Why is this important? Because regulations are coming; they’re coming hard. In the next few months, I expect the runaway stablecoin market to trigger all sorts of regulations from all sorts of three-letter Agencies:

*google:* ""coindesk spooky stablecoins""

Not sure about you, but I’d rather not be on the wrong side of Howey when that crew announces, “Hammertime!” So does TITAN pass it? I’m no lawyer, but I can’t see how the Fourth Prong is satisfied when there’s no developer, no promoter, to profit from TITAN by marketing it, because there’s no developer or promoter that owns it! The genie’s out of the bottle with this one. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, well then…..you should:

*google:* ""medium howey test citrus farmer crypto""

Or, for a deep dive into Howey Test Failures, check out the prestigious, 8 member Community I started:

*While in Reddit search:* ""HoweyTestFailures""

Now, it's important to remember, DRC is an Ethereum coin, while TITAN runs on Polygon, so it's faster and easier to use.

Well, what about cheaper? Didn't I mention Bitcoin earlier? That's why I saved the best for last. TITAN is about 40,000,000,000 times cheaper than Bitcoin - a real deal, right? Well, there's a reason for that - the supply is about 2,000,000 times larger. The unfortunate result of the bankrun is an almost incomprehensible supply - more than 35,000,000,000,000 TITAN. But the Community has already established a burning program, and more than 28 billion are already burnt:

*google:* ""polygon dead token address""

Finally, keep this in mind - no one reading this now will ever see the last Bitcoin mined:

*google:* ""buy bitcoin worldwide how many bitcoin""

Litecoin either, because it's simply a defter version of Bitcoin:

*google:* ""litecoin halving all you need""

These two foundational cryptocurrencies won't circulate their full supply for another 120 years, but TITAN does it, right now! There's no miners to deal with, no computer algorithms, no halving events. All the TITAN there ever is, or ever will be, is simply sitting out there on the Polygon Chain, waiting to be exchanged as a store of value, staked in Liquidity Pools, or provided to yield-farms for governance tokens. So I'll say it.....right now, TITAN is like Bitcoin in 120 years. Actually, right now, TITAN is probably BETTER than Bitcoin will ever be in 120 years.

It's so simple.

Look, WE - you, me, the TITAN Community - WE have the ability to make TITAN valuable. No one else. The supply on Polygon is fixed! It's vested! That's the beauty of this coin; that's what distinguishes it from everything else.

Oh, and one more thing - Elon Musk can keep Dogecoin and its leaky bucket - because we've got Mark Cuban. That's right, the billionaire investor, Shark-Tank entrepreneur, and Dallas Mavericks' owner, not only supported TITAN, he wrote a blog post explaining the benefits of Liquidity Pooling. Don't believe me? Check it:

Unfortunately, soon after that, he got wrecked, along with everyone else, when the bankrun dropped TITAN's value from $64.19 one day to $.000000015109 the next.   Is he salty about it? Probably. Has he forgotten about it? Maybe. But truly, no one knows.

What I do know is he wrote a book called ""How to Win at the Sport of Business"":

*google:* ""goodreads sport of business""

He's obviously a competitive person; most billionaires are.

So as he sits back and watches Elon Musk continue to overlay holograms of Shiba Inu dogs on his mirrored sunglasses, what do you think he will do when he realizes a unique set of circumstances has transformed TITAN, a coin he once supported, into the purest, fastest, cheapest, most-democratic cryptocurrency ever created?

If you're like me, you can't wait to find out.

We've seen all the good things crypto has done like pay for rent, medical bills, even the covid response of some countries! 

However, some governments still think it is evil. While I know that crypto won't solve all of our problems, I think it's still a step in the right direction to democratize the global financial ecosystem.

That is, to bring power back to the people and away from the big banks and governments.

I remember that sometime ago, there was a poll that asked how much crypto do you have, but it was in terms of USD, and majority were below USD 1,000 as far as I can recall. I'm taking this in a different take, to measure it based on a more personal perspective without disclosing much.

I thought of it for a while, and figured that the best indicator could be based on your monthly salary. This way, it's easier to see where you are at considering that the average yearly income in the world is at USD 9,000+, and there's a significant amount of disparity to it. Therefore, someone's USD 1,000 could be very much different from the other person. 

The key here is to better know the profiles of some sub-redditors in here, and probably to just keep the conversation going to know about the common benchmarks.

So, in comparison to your monthly salary, what is the value of your crypto portfolio?
