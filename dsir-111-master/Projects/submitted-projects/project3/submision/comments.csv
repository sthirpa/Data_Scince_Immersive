It sure isn't. But this subreddit certainly represents a more 'popular' or 'adopted' consensus of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general. I've talked to a number of people who don't know or care to know about it. They know *of* it, but do they use it? No. They don't need to. If anything, most people I talk to make fun of 'crypto bros' who only talk about their portfolios and flipping NFTs.

Anyone can make claims about whether something is good or bad (morally or ethically), but most information being spread about Solana is at best cursory, and at worst misunderstood. Most hear about things about network outages related to DoS or transaction overloads (which it can still do more of than any network at the highest speed). 

Rarely do I see threads like this one where it accounts *why* that might occur, which can be done by reading core snippets of [Solana's whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf) and providing any sort of fundamental critique of the blockchain - something that's touched upon all the time (centralization and barrier-to-entry for validators), but hardly references that it's a technical limitation of the blockchain.",CryptoCurrency

Or you could maybe modify the hardware a little or do something with it to make it into a crypto wallet.

"I don't want to downplay the ideas of Ford, and probably no one will read this anyways, but have to say this: It feels like this is written to make it sound more similar to BTC than his idea actually was.

You got to understand the time frame: Gold and silver standards where the norm for the whole 19th century. This means: one unit of such a currency could be exchanged for a specific fixed amount of gold or silver. But this was changing globally: Because it created a lot of issues in war/post-war economy, most countries already turned away from gold standards to other monetary systems, mostly fia, after WWI. The US sticked to the gold standard for quite long, officially until 1935, but in 1921 it was already crystal clear for anyone with economic insight that the US would sooner or later abolish the gold standard, too. And people were discussing alternatives.

This is were Ford comes in. His idea was simple: Instead of ""one unit of this currency gets you a fixed amount of gold"" it should be ""one unit of this currency gives you a fixed amount of energy"". An energy standard if you will. He makes this very clear:

&gt;The standard American dollar is approximately one-twentieth of an ounce of gold. Under the currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to one dollar.

The idea has actually not very much in common with PoW cryptocurrencies like BTC. These use energy to compute mathematical problems, to in turn mine new currency and handle transactions. Energy is used, sure, but it's surely not an energy standard. In short: It's not and was never meant to be a currency where 1 BTC = A fixed amount of Kwh. The only actual overlap those to systems have is: They both got something to do with energy. But that's it. I could easily make the case that this system has more in common with petrocurrencies for example than with PoW cryptocurrencies.",CryptoCurrency

To be fair, though, Narendra Modi, Gary Gensler, and the embalmed corpse of Charlie Munger can't just call for a ban on the economy the way they can for crypto. The main thing that's clear from that graph is that, while the economy as a whole grows, individual asset classes ebb and flow.

"Correct. Monero wallets, transaction amounts, and transaction participants are, by themselves, very secure.

The only ways for an entity can trace your wallet/transactions is through honeypotting. If you check your wallet balance on a 3rd party website collecting your browsing info, or deposit/withdraw at a public atm, or transact with wallets deliberately recording your transaction history, that information is collected and used to construct a wallet profile that is cross referenced with similar profiles. At best, this is an approximation of an identity.

In short, a transaction protocol is only as secure as its end user. Should someone wise up to being tracked online, all they need to do is send their monero to another wallet and not do the above mentioned compromising acts.",CryptoCurrency

"That‚Äôs only one of the points I disagree with. Clearly the success of crypto.com and user growth affects the CRO price given the incentives to stake. A big cause of the price increase is new users staking to increase earn rewards and discounts on fees. They couldn‚Äôt be more related. 

Your argument that a decrease in rewards will lead to the price of CRO lowering depends on them being related actually. You can‚Äôt decide on how you think this fictional world you‚Äôve created works from point to point. You rig the rules to switch depending on how it helps your argument.

Your argument reads like someone with sour grapes who missed out.

They shouldn‚Äôt focus on marketing? Like what? What world do you live in? Look around at everything you own. That‚Äôs 95% because of marketing. You don‚Äôt actually love Coca Cola for its great recipe, FYI. And new users wouldn‚Äôt come to crypto.com if they spent this marketing budget on coding. Marketing is literally everything in most spaces, but especially cryptocurrency. Or are Doge and Shiba mainly loved for their incredible architecture? It‚Äôs all about buzz and they‚Äôre proving it with their success and the success of their token.

The ad was cringe? It‚Äôs a stunningly sharp, well written,  well performed and well edited ad starring one of the biggest movie stars in the world. You couldn‚Äôt get a less scammy vibe. Maybe if you hired Barak Obama. And the amount they spent on it guarantees that they tested it into oblivion to the point that it definitely does what they want it to do. Your dislike of it is more a sign of your bitterness and lack of being in touch with what people like, than a sign of a problem with the ad.",CryptoCurrency

I ask myself this question a lot. I knew about shib in Feb, and even 200 dollars in shib would be worth a lot now. But I didn't get any because I thought my portfolio was too full. I had the same situation with quant and Elrond Gold. It's really hard to guess which ones are going to moon, if you only have 4, chances are you will choose the wrong one. 

So now, I think that there's nothing wrong with having 20 or so and just holding them. There's probably nothing wrong with having even more than that either.

I would really love to hear people that defend fiat being the best. Imagine if crypto was here first and then The FED came in and said what the dollar was, how banks would be like, and that it should replace crypto. I would really love to have that conversation first before people laugh off crypto.

He will not do anything stupid, that will hurt his votebank. The average age of crypto investors in India is 24-25 years. And the same age group, is also the reason he is in power.

You can participate yes, when there is a vote I believe you can contribute based on your stake, though its been so long since I did it I can't remember the ins and outs.

It is nice and simple though. Couple of insights, if you want to unstake, you've got to wait 28d for CRO to unbond. Once every 28d you're allowed to instant switch validators without unbonding. Rewards can be claimed whenever you like, and rewarded CRO is not staked so you may stake it back in, or withdraw it, cronos bridge it, whatever you like.

"S&amp;P 500 growth ETFs hit record highs on Wednesday and are outperforming the benchmark SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) year to date.

The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VOOG), SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW) all recorded intraday highs on Wednesday's session.

All three have also outdone SPY‚Äôs +25.5% YTD performance. VOOG is +30%, SPYG is +29.9% and IVW is +29.8%.

S&amp;P 500 Growth ETFs are made up of stocks that display the strongest growth characteristics based on: sales growth, P/E ratios, and momentum.

Moreover, the funds have very similar trading performances because they're essentially the same fund offered by different issuers.

Each ETF tracks the Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs 500 Growth Index. The two key differences between the ETFs are their assets under management and their expense ratios.

IVW leads the charge from an AUM vantage point with $39.42B under its belt. SPYG comes in second with $15.25B AUM, followed by VOOG at $4.65B.

Expense-ratio-wise, SPYG is the cheapest of the ETFs with an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VOOG is the second most costly fund at 0.10% and IVW is the most expensive with a ratio of 0.18%.

Fund flows for the three ETFs seem to follow expense ratios. Lowest-priced SPYG attracted $2.59B in inflows so far this year, while the second-most-affordable fund VOOG brought in $1.06B, according to etfdb.com. However, IVW ‚àí the most expensive ETF of the three ‚àí lost $1.67B to outflows.

**From a performance standpoint, all three have not only outperformed SPY on a YTD stance, but have also** ***outdone SPY in every timeframe from one-month to 10-year performance.***",StockMarket

"Hi, 

First rull: Don't invest money you need. So don't invest money you will need in the coming months. How longer your investment timefram, how more confortable it will be to invest that money.

Second rull: Diversify! 

With a small amount to invest (1000 USD), I would buy an etf and be patient with it. Trading with 1000 USD will cost you to much in transaction fees and to big risk taking.

&amp;#x200B;

Invest in what? 

There are many possibilities, but I wouldn't invest in Cryptos. The composition of the crypto investors community is heavily young investors that invest 1000 USD - 5000 USD (all their savings). This is bearish for the cryptos when a big part of those young crypto investors will need that invested money back to finance inflation that will hit daily expenses hard in 2022/2023!

I would invest in a commodity (the physical commodity, not the miners in your case) that is scarce at today's prices. 

Uranium fits very well in that category. Soon or later (coming months or couple of years) the price will need to be at 60+ USD/lb (It's a mathematical fact). And today the spotprice of uranium is around 45 USD/lb. So investing in Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is a no brainer. 

An alternative: If you ant bigger potential in that same space you can buy URNM etf, a 100% pure uranium sector etf.

"I would also add that few if any will outperform the index but that they likely also try to do so by taking higher risks. So you really also have to adjust returns for that higher risk factor. Index funds will likely be lower risk/volatility.

They actually claim that, ""nearly 1 in 3 households turn to Nextdoor to access trusted information, give and get help, and build real-world connections with people and organizations nearby...""

That's a complete load of horse shit. I do not believe that even 1 in 3 households has a person with the app installed. I would believe it if they said that the cumulative number of app installs in the US is equal to 1/3 the number of households. They're actually claiming that every single install of the app means a household not only installed it, but used it for ""trusted information."" That's completely specious. I read a lot of SEC filings. I read dozens of prospectuses a week. That's the most horse-shitty prospectus that's I've *ever read*.

""Nextdoor is the neighborhood network that brings all of these stakeholders together to get things done locally and build thriving communities.""

"The reality is that these were always junk bonds. Who are the offshore holders? Hedge funds. What is a hedge fund? A financial pool designed to usually lose a little money, but provide liquidity in a (local) bear market.

Hedge funds go broke and get rolled up all the time. Not a big deal. The money that is in them can be lost. It is basically a special type of insurance for rich people, so that when there is a recession, they have money to buy everything up and get even richer. That involves buying lots of foreign junk bonds. Those go bad all the time. This is one big batch going bad at once, but so what? A hedge fund is a corporation. It can go out of business, and the managers just start a new one. The people invested in them don't really mind. What they care about is that the money is *hedged.*

A dead hedge fund can't crash a market. Which is good, because nobody in China cares about foreign investors.",StockMarket

"Yeah I‚Äôve spent at least ten minutes on this lol. I‚Äôve co-authored a report on the causes of the financial crisis, and I‚Äôve even done work on MBS litigation relating to the fallout. 

The housing bubble and the foreclosure crisis was caused by households, fueled by easy and cheap credit. Note that for the most part lending *standards* did not actually change much‚Äîit just became cheaper to get loans and borrowers needed less collateral. In other words, it‚Äôs not that unqualified borrowers were getting predatory loans‚Äîit‚Äôs that qualified borrowers were getting leveraged up to their eyeballs because they thought they couldn‚Äôt lose. [Source](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20874/w20874.pdf)

I know this runs against the populist narrative but that narrative scapegoats a small group and lets most people off way too easy. The crisis wasn‚Äôt caused by poor people‚Äîthe bubble originated with and was mainly related to normal, prime borrowers. [Source](https://www.nber.org/digest/aug15/us-foreclosure-crisis-was-not-just-subprime-event) 

The subprime and NINJA and exotic loan stories dominated the media narrative, but those loans were always a very small fraction of the market and came pretty late during the bubble. At most they exacerbated the eventual crisis but they were not the cause‚Äîthey were a consequence, because in any asset bubble people tend to take on too much debt as they perceive little risk when prices are rising. You can see this today among retail traders‚Äîoptions and margin trading is SO much fun in a bull market. 

This isn‚Äôt to absolve wall st of all blame, and certainly there were contagion risk issues that they should‚Äôve anticipated. Wall St messed up in how they packaged these loans and how they managed risk. But ultimately they would never really have been able to protect themselves from such a legendary bubble‚Äîa bubble that was global, by the way, which is further evidence that this wasn‚Äôt just due to wall st‚Äôs exotic loans (which weren‚Äôt an issue in Europe). And maybe it‚Äôs natural for people to get caught up in a bubble, in which case true blame lies on the Fed and the government for encouraging cheap and easy credit.",StockMarket

No and here‚Äôs why. There are hundreds of thousands of variables and factors involving hundreds millions of people in thousands and thousands of locations that determine the market trajectory.

"I wouldn‚Äôt use this technique to measure the stability of the housing market. Zillow recently backed out of a failed venture to buy and flip houses. The stages of forbearance rate may offer a better indicator of things to come. In 2008 the forbearance rate reached +/- 8% and on top of that insurance companies were bundling garbage loans with good loans and reselling the servicing. When over 8% of people defaulted on there loans and went into foreclosure the game was over and the government had to intervene. Hardly anyone was held accountable on wall street and we had quantitative easing  (printing money) to help the US out of the recession. Not to mention, the credit rating companies like Moody‚Äôs were too corrupt to blow the whistle and bite the hand that feeds them. It seems like no one who could have prevented this was willing to call out banks and insurance companies for selling garbage mortgage bundles disguised as good mortgage bundles.",StockMarket

"The problem is that algorithms that do well in backtests now, might not (read: don't) do well in backtests in a couple years.

Algorithmic traders alter their algorithms over time. With AI, you don't know what it is doing. You'd have to constantly re-train it.

AI is more useful as an analysis tool to help find correlations that you can use to drive the continuous tuning of more traditional algorithmic trading methods.

"It needs to happen, that's all I know. If the stock market runs on a blockchain the the people with the upper hand won't have as much of an upper hand anymore. It would level the playing field. Market ""makers"" breakers will no longer be able to hide their transactions. No one will have to rely on media's words to be truthful and/or accurate when they report transactions which would otherwise be unavailable to public scrutiny for long enough they're already irrelevant by time people can see them. 

Examples of problems that can be solved includes: a market maker claims not to be shorting a specific ticker but is actually long on put contracts so is therefore shorting the underlying ticker, people buy that ticker in belief the market ""maker"" breaker is long on the ticker, retail investors believe they would be trading along with and on the same side as the market ""makers"" breakers but they were lied to and acted in good faith in an environment that rewards dishonesty and abuse of power rather than punishing it, as market ""makers"" breakers get to see the information a Blockchain would provide to the public weeks or even months before the public does they have an unfair advantage; this advantage includes the ability to monitor specific investor accounts up to the second (rather than quarterly) so they may use their vast amounts of money to target specific investors and tickers with attacks and to determine which type of attacks to use in order to cause the most damage to the market/specific investor/specific ticker/public, using their information advantage to target accounts with ""stop hunting"" and ""forced liquidations"" where billions of dollars will be moved in and/or out then the opposite in order to ensure as few investors as possible actually make money on their trades.

In lamens, we need the stock market to run on a blockchain so that when Citadel Securities buys billions of dollars worth of futures and options contracts, then immediately sells them in the time it takes to move the mouse from the buy button to the sell button or if they dump a stock every time retail investors buy we can hold them accountable for market manipulation. We will be able to prove they're using the fact they can force the public to lose money even if they made good investments as the reason for their trades. We will be able to prove that they're targeting specific investors by correlating their multi billion dollar attacks. We will be able to prove what their position is even when they're lying to us - and we'll be able to do so without waiting for their quarterly report even though they can see what we're doing up to the second. We will be able to keep everyone honest by force, not ""if necessary,"" but because it is necessary - like keeping body cams on police or using your phone camera to record an argument with a liar...just gotta keep everybody honest because they know they'll be held accountable...which of course they'll find new ways to do harm after a short period of not doing the dishonest things, but it will be a lot harder for them to get away with it and some of their attacks will just not be viable outright...and there's more reasons than all that too, like the fact that we would be able to do our taxes more easily...",StockMarket

Autos were a huge value play in the late nineties and value investors capitalized huge on the names. Their multiples were mostly below 10 because everyone was happier buying pets.com. With the exception of Volkswagon, the investment media was neutral. Even still Volkswagon had long since recovered by the time the GME style squeeze happened. Most value investors had exited by then, supporting my point the trading was primarily linked to valuation and not pie in the sky wishful thinking at an infinite multiple. What we have today is a huge bubble where all ethics have been disregarded. Analysts will be jailed behind what is happening here and perhaps some CEOs too.

"&gt;its already happening. XPENG literally copied everything from the hardware to the software. They have all of the same model that tesla has so far, and will probably have in the future. They have also copied the supercharger tech.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if that wasn't enough, the cutting edge that tesla had over the other EV competitors, is that tesla cars have really advanced software imbedded aka ""autopilot"", that tech alone is worth billions/trillions and it worked as an ""insurance"" that would allow tesla to have an edge over not only US/EU ev companies, but against China EVs. Because no matter what, even if the Chinese were to copy every  hardware component of a tesla, at the end of the day tesla still had the software lead.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, that has change with Xpeng. Not only did they steal/copy every hardware tech, but they aggressively recruited a top software lead engineer at tesla who was 1 of 40 engineers who had exclusive access to the entire autopilot codebase.  
&gt;  
&gt;That engineer went and copied the entire codebase, air dropped it to his laptop, and peaced out of tesla before tesla could get wind of it. Handed it over to Xpeng for huge sums of $$$$$, promoted to director of ""xpilot"" at xpeng. this was back in 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, on teslas end they somehow knew he had stole the codebase, Sue'd him. Took over a year, but no luck. hard to prove software code IP protection. they ended up settling out of court. That engineer confessed that he indeed stole the autopilot codebase, ""airdropped"" it to his laptop. but in the end ended up deleted the entire thing, before he moved to china to work at xpeng.  xpeng as well said, ""no we never copied autopilot, we created xpilot from scratch, okkkk"". also xpeng ended up firing the engineer, as proof that they dont condone that kind of irresponsibility. keep in mind it has already been over a year since the engineer has been working as a director positon at xpeng. Xpeng probably paid him a huge sum of money, that helped that engineer keep his mouth shut, and happy.  
&gt;  
&gt;From a elon tweet, he accused of xpeng of stealing their autopilot from their 2021 demonstration of showing their cars auto parking themselves. Says they were using their ""version 1"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless, xpeng just saved itself +10 years of R and D, along with billions of $$$$ to develop this. Its literally a tesla autopilot. With it, their software stack has a strong foundation, all they need now is data which they can get when they sell more cars and their users drive it.   
&gt;  
&gt;Meaning, that xpeng is staged to possibly become one of the bigger EVs if they can somehow figure out the production side of their cars. And even if they somehow fail, they still have the IP for xpilot which can go for huge sums of $$$ if they end up being acquired by some other huge China EV (aka byd maybe).",StockMarket

"Yes but interest rates are so far away from being attractive compared to the market. I mean, honestly, they‚Äôll have to go above 6% before they‚Äôll catch the attention of most investors. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gotten less than 6% in my portfolio, except one year in the past decade. I even made a killing in 2020 by buying when everyone else was rushing out. I set triggers for GTC orders. Today, for example, I got Poshmark at a screaming deal. Why? Because I set a trade to execute at $14.07 a long time ago. I do it this way bc it keeps my emotions out of it. I decide a ‚Äúbuy price,‚Äù a ‚Äúbuy more price‚Äù and a ‚Äúpaid off price.‚Äù So after my $14.07 buy price executed, I set a sell order that is GTC (good till cancelled) that will sell half of my shares once the price is better than $28.14. So, when they executes someday, it‚Äôll take half my shares and get out what I bought today. No watching the market like a drug-fueled broker and yet, my portfolio keeps growing. I also set a ‚Äúbuy more price‚Äù of $7.00, so if it goes down, I dollar cost average and snag a bump in my total share count. It works really well.",StockMarket

"This is a demonstration of the effect, where you're over-estimating your understanding of the effect.

&gt; That type of person

The Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with the type of person. If you think it doesn't apply to you, that implies you don't understand the effect.

It isn't about a type of person, and it isn't something you can avoid. It maps the knowledge you think you have against the knowledge you actually have. When you start out, and you gain a little bit of knowledge, you rapidly feel like you're mastering the subject. That top of that, the Dunning-Kruger peak, is typically what people are talking about when they talk about the Dunning-Kruger effect. But then if you continue gaining additional knowledge, you realize how much more there is to learn, and your perception of your own knowledge level plummets. Then as you keep learning, your perception of your knowledge grows again, and eventually when you're close to mastering the subject, for the first time since right before you started learning, you have an accurate perception of your knowledge level.üëº",StockMarket

"The problem with blaming hedge funds is that if they could do it before, they'll do it again, and it means the stock is marked for death.

Their 10Q says they have only $16m in current assets, and $12m in current liabilities for the past quarter. And they lost $3m on operations.

Their 10Q also says:

&gt;Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily through a combination of debt and equity financings. Management anticipates continuing to raise additional capital from the sale of its securities or through agreements, such as potential partnering events of the Company‚Äôs existing technology. However, no assurance can be given as to whether the Company will achieve these objectives. Based on the Company‚Äôs current business plan, management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company‚Äôs obligations for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company‚Äôs ability to execute its operating plan depends on its ability to obtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings or potential licensing and collaboration arrangements. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. ***However, the Company‚Äôs current working capital, anticipated operating expenses and net operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year following the date that these financial statements are issued.***

"I use Fidelity and the features I care about are:

* I can buy almost any stock, including OTC stocks, with no commissions or fees
* They do not use payment-for-order-flow (PFOF), they're big enough to be their own market-maker. This results in ""price improvements"" because of US market rules requiring the broker to give you their best price.
* They offer good research tools and stock screeners through a web browser. It's silly to do research on a phone.
* They also have an app, so if I need to panic sell, I can. (/s)
* Contingent trades, including multi-contingent, so that I can do a market sell based on last trade bracket. With limit orders, if the stock gaps up past your target price, you're likely to get your limit price on the open, but with a market order you'll get the higher price.",StockMarket

"Hi, I do both stock and leaps investing. Personally, for leaps, I prefer to go for individual companies than the index when talking far otm. Reason being that it's more likely a few star companies will do well than the whole QQQ.

For ETFs like QQQ, you might also consider bull call debit spreads. I know you lose the unlimited gain potential, but in the case of QQQ, diversification itself limits that. A spread closer ITM with a long enough expiry can yield pretty good risk-to-returns too. Personally I try placing limit orders on spreads around 0.5-0.4 delta, with a price at 33% of the over spread value. So if the spread values are 450-460, my maximum limit order is 3.33 since the max value on the spread is 10.",StockMarket

"As long as you learned your mistake (which I'm not sure you have, given that you're considering getting back into the stock!)

Ask yourself why you bought it in the first place. Did you think you could outsmart the market? Was it because it crashed SO hard because of the pandemic? Either way, if this is the only stock you hold, and you bought it for the above reasons (or similar), then your mistake was made long before you started losing money on it.

There are honestly HUNDREDS of better businesses to put your money into. Think long term. Don't let the pandemic exclusively sway your decision on the stock choice you make. It may be around 6 more months, or 6 more years... Nobody knows.

Invest in a money that will thrive in 1, 5, 10+ years, regardless of the current global situation. These cruise companies, despite having a ton of cash, burn through a ton of it every month they are not out at sea. I've been working in travel for over 10 years (cruise for 4).

Honestly, at your age and with your experience, just invest in the US top 100, or better yet, so some basic research on the top 10/25, and invest your money into one of those. Some are presenting decent entry points at the moment, others are overvalued, but you'll still over the long term see much more positive (and reliable!) Outcomes than with your current strategy.

Here is an example, I invested in Pfizer while it was rallying up to the Covid vaccine FDA approval. Sold it slightly before emotionally but still made about 7% overall.
After I bought back in, it continued to drop all the way down to 43 in 2 months.

I kept buying as I knew it had been working on a Covid treatment pill, I also knew it will do well in earnings.

The pill was a risk, but a risk I was willing to take. I didn't know when it will bottom so I just kept investing small amount.
Pfizer has broke its ATH twice in the last 2 weeks, even before the new variant (I didn't even consider it tbh). Currently I am up about 13% overall and over 20% from my lowest buy, in about a month.

"You know this actually is a great example of why Warren Buffet isn't in crypto and he's too old and rich to care about learning a new technology. I realize that may at first glance appear as if I'm taking a shot at him, but it's referring to his talk about cryptocurrencies at shareholder meetings recently (and probably other things I haven't watched). I have the utmost respect for Warren Buffett - A true living legend, but this helps clarify why he's against the adoption of cryptocurrency. His simple lack of knowledge of it and the technology behind it spoken in his own words so many years ago. He actually probably wishes all of us crypto investors the best of luck, as he says in this video he doesn't care if people beat him to something if he doesn't understand it enough to properly valuate it.

"No and mutations are kind of random but there are sequences that have higher rates of mutation.

And on to the randomness of genetic mutation, I can‚Äôt give you a a degree in molecular biology in a comment as you don‚Äôt know anything about it but no statistically dna sequences that have higher numbers of A/T pairs over G/C pairs mutates easier as A/T only have 2 hydrogen bonds between them and makes them easier to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù dna strands and has less intermolecular forces to interfere with an incorrect pairing. Now there are mutations that can occur on protein coding too but those are typically one off and not passes down during replication.

"I assume they applied for EUA with their interim data of 50% efficacy. So that's probably what the FDA will be primarily looking at. 

However, the huge drop implies in their second half of the trial the efficacy was around 10%. With a sample size this big it's really unlikely this is due to just statistical variations. It could be a sudden trend reversal due to delta, which would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless by now. 

Another possibility is they cherry picked a sub group of high risk people for their interim analysis. It would make sense since their orders with the US are conditional on EUA approval and they are gonna allow generic manufacturing in poorer countries anyways. In that case it could be granted EUA just for this subgroup, certainly though the FDA is not gonna simply ignore that if they did.

Molnupiravir's Mechnism of Action is basically mutating enough errors into the viral replication so that the replication fails. There is potentially the danger of mutating human DNA as well with unkown long term side effects. On top of that, new variants could evolve faster by this mutation accelerator. 

Merck's drug looks more and more like a very expensive and ineffective burden with unkown risks involved. My guess is Pfizer's Paxlovid will probably be the answer for high risk population as an antiviral agent and Bucillamine potentially the pill for standard risk population as an anti-inflammatory agent. Even combination of both will be considered since their MOAs work complementary.",StockMarket

"Isn‚Äôt it optimistic to think a recovery will occur within a week? If we assume the variant does spread, every day 1+ new country finds the variant, news fuels speculation, fear can still grip the markets. Under this assumption, buying now is a dangerous idea when we could be in the first stage of a new spread of unknown scale.

Best case scenario, the variant found has not started spreading widely and it would have to completely stall for a week or something and disappear for that level of optimism. Then, scientists would need to show reduced transmissibility and vaccine superiority against the virus. However, this usually takes weeks to discover and as of now, WHO seems to support the theory of this strain having higher chances of reinfection. As to lethality, it‚Äôs anyones guess but I‚Äôm praying it‚Äôs low. So again, buying now seems like a dangerous idea. Maybe at least wait it out till next Friday for better clarity on the situation.

Next there is the problem of debt and liquidity. The pandemic screwed the finances of cruises and the industry is on a lifeline. If this guillotine falls with ferocity, they may need another bailout that may or may not come.

"While he want poor - he made a lot of money on his own early on

‚ÄúBuffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000.[20] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[21] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They sold the business later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.[22]‚Äù",StockMarket

"That's really cheap!

It closed at $3.45 ($345), they already made bank.

They must have bought that in the morning, before AMD went up.

It means nothing for tomorrow because their bet already paid off, $155+1.65=$156.65 and it closed at $157.80.

So even if you assume this person has a crystal ball, it is still meaningless. But if you watch the option chains, lots of people make last-minute bets like this and lose. There are a lot of $160 calls that could win tomorrow, but likely won't, and a lot of 165 and even 170 that are doomed. There will be about 2/3rds as many losing puts, too, assuming only small moves in the short session tomorrow. So these mini-bulls are winning, but options make bulls and bears into pigs.

There is a whole lot of 150 puts expiring in 3 weeks, but even more 160 calls, and 165 + 170 calls are also both big. Does it mean anything? More bulls than bears on AMD. I wouldn't bet on it either way; they're a great company, but their supply is limited beyond their control, and the shortages have hurt them. Their growth is limited by fab access. The stock price will not move based on the options chain.

U.S. voters do not have a good concensus of the economy despite the growth of make work projects - i mean jobs.,StockMarket
"I am hoping that cooler heads prevail and they go slow with the tightening. There are many signs that they understand the following:
1) the current inflation is a supply problem, not a demand problem 
2) raising rates will make it a demand problem too. It will taking a moderate problem and making it a huge problem because now unemployment will be up and everything will still be expensive. More gov spending to help those who are struggling. 
3) the supply problem is mainly due to labor due to covid
4) covid impacts are transitory to some degree unless governments permanently make it easy to stay away from work (which would bother me but ultimately I‚Äôm fine with as long as rates stay low and assets stay up.. I can afford this inflation with the asset appreciation I have experienced)
5) much of the uproar is over price increases related every day items that either have complex supply chain routes or are impacted by domestic US labor. The gov should continue with targeted shots to address those items (think oil reserves)

Best outcome: Inflation cools as covid wanes. Low rates, strong demand and low unemployment through out. Use your asset gains to cover any permanent increases in pricing (and yes some of this is now driven by higher wages and is therefore permanent). US gets to continue to take advantage of prime position as the world reserve currency - backed by the most powerful military ever known to man and our massive financial markets and levels of consumption. We are only halfway through a demographic driven secular bull run.

Worst outcome: break the economy trying to fix inflation. Get stagflation. Domestic and global unrest accelerates, markets are crashed, unemployment high. Combo of much higher taxes,  and welfare programs or it goes the way of austerity. A civil or international war breaks out. The dollar goes into hyper inflation. Move into other currencies (potential heavy allocation to crypto) and wait out the storm as safely as you can. Move somewhere safer. 

One note: if the rates stay low and the market continues to rip in the US, more and more people will retire early. At some point this will be a problem for productivity, inflation or more speciality services and products, and may require some tax law changes to keep the gov money flowing- or they can always raise rates, bring assets down and force people back in to the market.",StockMarket
"I believe his point here is that he personally has so much money in the company that if he were to remove large chunks of his funds quickly, it would actually bring the stock price down and would continue to keep selling in those chunks at a much lower cost.

And line expansion for ford is cheap in comparison to tesla or others bc ford already has assembly lines and they're building battery factories to achieve 200k plus units annually.... As a former fleet manager if I was still buying cargo vans ford would have my order.,StockMarket
"No it‚Äôs not, not even close. Back then OPEC cut the world off and the price of oil spiked to over $110 per barrel. That was what ultimately set off the 1973 recession. Adjusting for inflation we are nowhere near those prices, and OPEC is not as powerful now as they were back then.",StockMarket
Wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt missing something,StockMarket
What planet are you on?  Core inflation strips out volatile items.  Throw them units 6%+.  Throw in a decent refection of rents etc and its more like.10%.,StockMarket
You obviously don't have any idea about the amount of.bonds Central banks now buy.  Do you think European junk bonds trade negative by natural mkt forces?,StockMarket

Ease of access will be all you need to get the regular sports fan to bet. Doing it on your phone in a matter of seconds instead of going to a sports book? Major cha-ching. I‚Äôm a New Yorker dying to bet legally. And if I can do it with the same ease and frequency I check my fantasy team? Huge win.",StockMarket
I am! Finally some good sales for Black Friday.,StockMarket

"I feel like very isolated as a liberal person interested in stock trading. A lot of the comments here are unfair right-wing talking points but I don't have capacity to address then all. Yes, this is largely for optics but so many of what Presidents do is optical and symbolic. Certainly the President and his team are pursuing other policy avenues to address gas costs, including investigating possible collusion in relation to gasoline prices.",StockMarket
This has to be the list of the easiest short plays of the market.,StockMarket

I think the US normally consumes that amount in a 24-72 hours,StockMarket
"I'm guessing you forgot he shut down all new fracking, and drilling on public federal land and off shore, which has caused the U.S. not to produce as much and had to start relying on foreign countries again. Yes, it's Biden's fault entirely we are no longer energy independent and gas prices are continuing to rise.",StockMarket

"I'm long oil, have been for a few years.

I was just starting to think about taking profits when this news hit. But looking at the numbers, the amount to be released is trivial and will at best make a small blip in the price chart.

"You are over simplifying it.  1% per day for 6 days mean you are up 19.4% because it is compounded ($100√ó1.03 six times is $119.41).  If it drops 18% (triple 3%) you are now at $97.91 so you are lower than what you started with by over 2%.

If it is just QQQ you gain 1% daily for 6 days and then lose 6% you end at $99.78 so almost break even.

There is constant slippage not to mention increased fees to manage TQQQ.",StockMarket
"All you have to do is open your eyes and look around you. All of my friends and a few coworkers where in the oil fields. There are NO new jobs there, it's shut down from Biden. During Trump gas prices were low because he opened up government restrictions. Biden gas prices are back on the rise because of his restrictions. Are you really this blind?",StockMarket
