94,aznkor,t2_8fyo5wpj,"S&amp;P 500 growth ETFs hit record highs on Wednesday and are outperforming the benchmark SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) year to date.

The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VOOG), SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW) all recorded intraday highs on Wednesday's session.

All three have also outdone SPY’s +25.5% YTD performance. VOOG is +30%, SPYG is +29.9% and IVW is +29.8%.

S&amp;P 500 Growth ETFs are made up of stocks that display the strongest growth characteristics based on: sales growth, P/E ratios, and momentum.

Moreover, the funds have very similar trading performances because they're essentially the same fund offered by different issuers.

Each ETF tracks the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Growth Index. The two key differences between the ETFs are their assets under management and their expense ratios.

IVW leads the charge from an AUM vantage point with $39.42B under its belt. SPYG comes in second with $15.25B AUM, followed by VOOG at $4.65B.

Expense-ratio-wise, SPYG is the cheapest of the ETFs with an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VOOG is the second most costly fund at 0.10% and IVW is the most expensive with a ratio of 0.18%.

Fund flows for the three ETFs seem to follow expense ratios. Lowest-priced SPYG attracted $2.59B in inflows so far this year, while the second-most-affordable fund VOOG brought in $1.06B, according to etfdb.com. However, IVW − the most expensive ETF of the three − lost $1.67B to outflows.

Main worry is the eBay exit I guess and the Pinterest saga which scared off some big money. 

PayPal has always been expensive, I think this is a great buying opportunity if you’re in to them. 

Personally I find the products and services utter shit so I don’t buy the stock either. The UI is from ‘97 and the apps have far too many technical problems.

243,Napalm-1,t2_a25q4a97,"Hi, 

First rull: Don't invest money you need. So don't invest money you will need in the coming months. How longer your investment timefram, how more confortable it will be to invest that money.

Second rull: Diversify! 

With a small amount to invest (1000 USD), I would buy an etf and be patient with it. Trading with 1000 USD will cost you to much in transaction fees and to big risk taking.

&amp;#x200B;

Invest in what? 

There are many possibilities, but I wouldn't invest in Cryptos. The composition of the crypto investors community is heavily young investors that invest 1000 USD - 5000 USD (all their savings). This is bearish for the cryptos when a big part of those young crypto investors will need that invested money back to finance inflation that will hit daily expenses hard in 2022/2023!

I would invest in a commodity (the physical commodity, not the miners in your case) that is scarce at today's prices. 

Uranium fits very well in that category. Soon or later (coming months or couple of years) the price will need to be at 60+ USD/lb (It's a mathematical fact). And today the spotprice of uranium is around 45 USD/lb. So investing in Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is a no brainer. 

An alternative: If you ant bigger potential in that same space you can buy URNM etf, a 100% pure uranium sector etf.

That's a complete load of horse shit. I do not believe that even 1 in 3 households has a person with the app installed. I would believe it if they said that the cumulative number of app installs in the US is equal to 1/3 the number of households. They're actually claiming that every single install of the app means a household not only installed it, but used it for ""trusted information."" That's completely specious. I read a lot of SEC filings. I read dozens of prospectuses a week. That's the most horse-shitty prospectus that's I've *ever read*.

""Nextdoor is the neighborhood network that brings all of these stakeholders together to get things done locally and build thriving communities.""

359,Goddess_Peorth,t2_9uq0c3g8,"The reality is that these were always junk bonds. Who are the offshore holders? Hedge funds. What is a hedge fund? A financial pool designed to usually lose a little money, but provide liquidity in a (local) bear market.

Hedge funds go broke and get rolled up all the time. Not a big deal. The money that is in them can be lost. It is basically a special type of insurance for rich people, so that when there is a recession, they have money to buy everything up and get even richer. That involves buying lots of foreign junk bonds. Those go bad all the time. This is one big batch going bad at once, but so what? A hedge fund is a corporation. It can go out of business, and the managers just start a new one. The people invested in them don't really mind. What they care about is that the money is *hedged.*

A dead hedge fund can't crash a market. Which is good, because nobody in China cares about foreign investors.",1639122843,hnyowbi,t3_rcxppo,/r/StockMarket/comments/rcxppo/how_can_the_defaults_of_evergrande_or_other/hnyowbi/,1,StockMarket,comment

536,khansian,t2_16urpd,"Yeah I’ve spent at least ten minutes on this lol. I’ve co-authored a report on the causes of the financial crisis, and I’ve even done work on MBS litigation relating to the fallout. 

The housing bubble and the foreclosure crisis was caused by households, fueled by easy and cheap credit. Note that for the most part lending *standards* did not actually change much—it just became cheaper to get loans and borrowers needed less collateral. In other words, it’s not that unqualified borrowers were getting predatory loans—it’s that qualified borrowers were getting leveraged up to their eyeballs because they thought they couldn’t lose. [Source](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20874/w20874.pdf)

I know this runs against the populist narrative but that narrative scapegoats a small group and lets most people off way too easy. The crisis wasn’t caused by poor people—the bubble originated with and was mainly related to normal, prime borrowers. [Source](https://www.nber.org/digest/aug15/us-foreclosure-crisis-was-not-just-subprime-event) 

The subprime and NINJA and exotic loan stories dominated the media narrative, but those loans were always a very small fraction of the market and came pretty late during the bubble. At most they exacerbated the eventual crisis but they were not the cause—they were a consequence, because in any asset bubble people tend to take on too much debt as they perceive little risk when prices are rising. You can see this today among retail traders—options and margin trading is SO much fun in a bull market. 

This isn’t to absolve wall st of all blame, and certainly there were contagion risk issues that they should’ve anticipated. Wall St messed up in how they packaged these loans and how they managed risk. But ultimately they would never really have been able to protect themselves from such a legendary bubble—a bubble that was global, by the way, which is further evidence that this wasn’t just due to wall st’s exotic loans (which weren’t an issue in Europe). And maybe it’s natural for people to get caught up in a bubble, in which case true blame lies on the Fed and the government for encouraging cheap and easy credit.",1638945459,hnouxpe,t1_hnns3hn,/r/StockMarket/comments/r9equl/everyone_is_into_stocks_or_crypto/hnouxpe/,1,StockMarket,comment

The stages of forbearance rate may offer a better indicator of things to come. In 2008 the forbearance rate reached +/- 8% and on top of that insurance companies were bundling garbage loans with good loans and reselling the servicing. When over 8% of people defaulted on there loans and went into foreclosure the game was over and the government had to intervene. Hardly anyone was held accountable on wall street and we had quantitative easing  (printing money) to help the US out of the recession.

624,EscapingTerminal,t2_a16vkp61,"It needs to happen, that's all I know. If the stock market runs on a blockchain the the people with the upper hand won't have as much of an upper hand anymore. It would level the playing field. Market ""makers"" breakers will no longer be able to hide their transactions. No one will have to rely on media's words to be truthful and/or accurate when they report transactions which would otherwise be unavailable to public scrutiny for long enough they're already irrelevant by time people can see them. 

Examples of problems that can be solved includes: a market maker claims not to be shorting a specific ticker but is actually long on put contracts so is therefore shorting the underlying ticker, people buy that ticker in belief the market ""maker"" breaker is long on the ticker, retail investors believe they would be trading along with and on the same side as the market ""makers"" breakers but they were lied to and acted in good faith in an environment that rewards dishonesty and abuse of power rather than punishing it, as market ""makers"" breakers get to see the information a Blockchain would provide to the public weeks or even months before the public does they have an unfair advantage; this advantage includes the ability to monitor specific investor accounts up to the second (rather than quarterly) so they may use their vast amounts of money to target specific investors and tickers with attacks and to determine which type of attacks to use in order to cause the most damage to the market/specific investor/specific ticker/public, using their information advantage to target accounts with ""stop hunting"" and ""forced liquidations"" where billions of dollars will be moved in and/or out then the opposite in order to ensure as few investors as possible actually make money on their trades.

In lamens, we need the stock market to run on a blockchain so that when Citadel Securities buys billions of dollars worth of futures and options contracts, then immediately sells them in the time it takes to move the mouse from the buy button to the sell button or if they dump a stock every time retail investors buy we can hold them accountable for market manipulation. We will be able to prove they're using the fact they can force the public to lose money even if they made good investments as the reason for their trades. We will be able to prove that they're targeting specific investors by correlating their multi billion dollar attacks. We will be able to prove what their position is even when they're lying to us - and we'll be able to do so without waiting for their quarterly report even though they can see what we're doing up to the second. We will be able to keep everyone honest by force, not ""if necessary,"" but because it is necessary - like keeping body cams on police or using your phone camera to record an argument with a liar...just gotta keep everybody honest because they know they'll be held accountable...which of course they'll find new ways to do harm after a short period of not doing the dishonest things, but it will be a lot harder for them to get away with it and some of their attacks will just not be viable outright...and there's more reasons than all that too, like the fact that we would be able to do our taxes more easily...",1638854111,hnk55c3,t3_raq7fr,/r/StockMarket/comments/raq7fr/does_anybody_know_anything_about_this_blockchain/hnk55c3/,1,StockMarket,comment

819,mjrisin2021,t2_a9dqt9o5,"No they didn’t. No conglomerate of investors or media have ever recommended buying either name at a high multiple. Autos were a huge value play in the late nineties and value investors capitalized huge on the names. Their multiples were mostly below 10 because everyone was happier buying pets.com. With the exception of Volkswagon, the investment media was neutral. Even still Volkswagon had long since recovered by the time the GME style squeeze happened. Most value investors had exited by then, supporting my point the trading was primarily linked to valuation and not pie in the sky wishful thinking at an infinite multiple. What we have today is a huge bubble where all ethics have been disregarded. Analysts will be jailed behind what is happening here and perhaps some CEOs too.

1154,HoboDayTrader,t2_nbdgbl,"&gt;its already happening. XPENG literally copied everything from the hardware to the software. They have all of the same model that tesla has so far, and will probably have in the future. They have also copied the supercharger tech.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if that wasn't enough, the cutting edge that tesla had over the other EV competitors, is that tesla cars have really advanced software imbedded aka ""autopilot"", that tech alone is worth billions/trillions and it worked as an ""insurance"" that would allow tesla to have an edge over not only US/EU ev companies, but against China EVs. Because no matter what, even if the Chinese were to copy every  hardware component of a tesla, at the end of the day tesla still had the software lead.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, that has change with Xpeng. Not only did they steal/copy every hardware tech, but they aggressively recruited a top software lead engineer at tesla who was 1 of 40 engineers who had exclusive access to the entire autopilot codebase.  
&gt;  
&gt;That engineer went and copied the entire codebase, air dropped it to his laptop, and peaced out of tesla before tesla could get wind of it. Handed it over to Xpeng for huge sums of $$$$$, promoted to director of ""xpilot"" at xpeng. this was back in 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, on teslas end they somehow knew he had stole the codebase, Sue'd him. Took over a year, but no luck. hard to prove software code IP protection. they ended up settling out of court. That engineer confessed that he indeed stole the autopilot codebase, ""airdropped"" it to his laptop. but in the end ended up deleted the entire thing, before he moved to china to work at xpeng.  xpeng as well said, ""no we never copied autopilot, we created xpilot from scratch, okkkk"". also xpeng ended up firing the engineer, as proof that they dont condone that kind of irresponsibility. keep in mind it has already been over a year since the engineer has been working as a director positon at xpeng. Xpeng probably paid him a huge sum of money, that helped that engineer keep his mouth shut, and happy.  
&gt;  
&gt;From a elon tweet, he accused of xpeng of stealing their autopilot from their 2021 demonstration of showing their cars auto parking themselves. Says they were using their ""version 1"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless, xpeng just saved itself +10 years of R and D, along with billions of $$$$ to develop this. Its literally a tesla autopilot. With it, their software stack has a strong foundation, all they need now is data which they can get when they sell more cars and their users drive it.   
&gt;  
&gt;Meaning, that xpeng is staged to possibly become one of the bigger EVs if they can somehow figure out the production side of their cars. And even if they somehow fail, they still have the IP for xpilot which can go for huge sums of $$$ if they end up being acquired by some other huge China EV (aka byd maybe).",1638427393,hmwjhfr,t1_hmsmvon,/r/StockMarket/comments/r6b332/teslas_shanghai_gigafactory_achieves_90/hmwjhfr/,1,StockMarket,comment

1173,BirdieJames,t2_5tyc01u5,"Yes but interest rates are so far away from being attractive compared to the market. I mean, honestly, they’ll have to go above 6% before they’ll catch the attention of most investors. I don’t think I’ve gotten less than 6% in my portfolio, except one year in the past decade. I even made a killing in 2020 by buying when everyone else was rushing out. I set triggers for GTC orders. Today, for example, I got Poshmark at a screaming deal. Why? Because I set a trade to execute at $14.07 a long time ago. I do it this way bc it keeps my emotions out of it. I decide a “buy price,” a “buy more price” and a “paid off price.” So after my $14.07 buy price executed, I set a sell order that is GTC (good till cancelled) that will sell half of my shares once the price is better than $28.14. So, when they executes someday, it’ll take half my shares and get out what I bought today. No watching the market like a drug-fueled broker and yet, my portfolio keeps growing. I also set a “buy more price” of $7.00, so if it goes down, I dollar cost average and snag a bump in my total share count.

1187,Goddess_Peorth,t2_9uq0c3g8,"This is a demonstration of the effect, where you're over-estimating your understanding of the effect.

&gt; That type of person

The Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with the type of person. If you think it doesn't apply to you, that implies you don't understand the effect.

It isn't about a type of person, and it isn't something you can avoid. It maps the knowledge you think you have against the knowledge you actually have. When you start out, and you gain a little bit of knowledge, you rapidly feel like you're mastering the subject. That top of that, the Dunning-Kruger peak, is typically what people are talking about when they talk about the Dunning-Kruger effect. But then if you continue gaining additional knowledge, you realize how much more there is to learn, and your perception of your own knowledge level plummets. Then as you keep learning, your perception of your knowledge grows again, and eventually when you're close to mastering the subject, for the first time since right before you started learning, you have an accurate perception of your knowledge level.👼",1638435241,hmwtmb5,t1_hmvpe1k,/r/StockMarket/comments/r6ukmj/behavioral_economics_and_psychology_of_investing/hmwtmb5/,3,StockMarket,comment

1196,Goddess_Peorth,t2_9uq0c3g8,"It's a political stock. Everybody who wanted in, got in, and most of them had to open a brokerage account to do it.

That means if a beta comes out or there is some news, they're just going to look at what they already bought. It will still be down, and so they won't buy more. These are not people who understand the market. They bought it to show their virtue, or to get rich like the people who went to T. U.

People who didn't buy it already, are not going to buy it on news of a beta. Look at the volume. All the volume was within a weak, and then it parked near zero.

And generally, PIPE announcements send SPACs down, not up. Most of the investors in a SPAC, even a regular SPAC, have no idea what is going on, they don't understand how the funding works, and they get very disappointed at the PIPE. Why would PIPE investors pay a bunch of money per share when there are a boatload (20m?) of $11.50 warrants? And a giant boatload of ""founder shares"" were sold for \[\~ nothing\]. A PIPE will generate funds for the company, and lower the stock price.

1218,Goddess_Peorth,t2_9uq0c3g8,"The problem with blaming hedge funds is that if they could do it before, they'll do it again, and it means the stock is marked for death.

Their 10Q says they have only $16m in current assets, and $12m in current liabilities for the past quarter. And they lost $3m on operations.

Their 10Q also says:

&gt;Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily through a combination of debt and equity financings. Management anticipates continuing to raise additional capital from the sale of its securities or through agreements, such as potential partnering events of the Company’s existing technology. However, no assurance can be given as to whether the Company will achieve these objectives. Based on the Company’s current business plan, management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s obligations for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company’s ability to execute its operating plan depends on its ability to obtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings or potential licensing and collaboration arrangements. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. ***However, the Company’s current working capital, anticipated operating expenses and net operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year following the date that these financial statements are issued.***

Fracked costs 4x as much as drilling. Furthermore, while he did say no new drilling on federal land, there is not a moratorium on currently drilled locations. ""Energy Independence"" also does not mean what you think it means. All it means is that we were a net exporter of energy commodities instead of importer. We still imported OPEC fuel, even during 2019 when we were ""Energy independent"". The term is meaningless because no one fucking knows what it means, and it's just a right wing buzzword. If you add in the post covid demand surge, OPEC fuckery, commodity price increases(316ss(really all API materials) has gone through the roof, and the US is not a primary producer of raw 316ss), crazy TX winter, and classic oil company fuckery, you get higher gas prices. Also, you picked a bad day to reply to this comment. If Biden were responsible for the price increase to ~$85 per barrel, is he also responsible for this week's plunge to ~$65 per barrel? Also, if you are an oil company, are you going to pay to frack at a cost of $100pb just to let some dipshit hillbillies jack off about meaningless ""Energy Independence""?Oil commodities are so fucking complicated with so many variables, it's ridiculous, and if you think you can predict the future because of the current president then fuck around with oil commodities and find out.

1314,alexstonks34,t2_gayh9ysb,"Hi, I do both stock and leaps investing. Personally, for leaps, I prefer to go for individual companies than the index when talking far otm. Reason being that it's more likely a few star companies will do well than the whole QQQ.

For ETFs like QQQ, you might also consider bull call debit spreads. I know you lose the unlimited gain potential, but in the case of QQQ, diversification itself limits that. A spread closer ITM with a long enough expiry can yield pretty good risk-to-returns too. Personally I try placing limit orders on spreads around 0.5-0.4 delta, with a price at 33% of the over spread value. So if the spread values are 450-460, my maximum limit order is 3.33 since the max value on the spread is 10.",1638249843,hmmo1b3,t3_r59r9t,/r/StockMarket/comments/r59r9t/you_guys_think_this_leap_option_is_a_good_play/hmmo1b3/,1,StockMarket,comment

With these services becoming the main place where public discussions happen, it's definitely a valid question of whether speech should have some protections there.

But it's such a crazy problem too, because on the other hand misinformation is an enormous problem. It's literally killed many people over the past couple years.

I'm not sure how either issue should be handled, but I am certain that the Twitter, Facebook, etc corporate interests do not align with the best interests of their users.

1394,SiimplStudio,t2_5gxq8fcx,"As long as you learned your mistake (which I'm not sure you have, given that you're considering getting back into the stock!)

Ask yourself why you bought it in the first place. Did you think you could outsmart the market? Was it because it crashed SO hard because of the pandemic? Either way, if this is the only stock you hold, and you bought it for the above reasons (or similar), then your mistake was made long before you started losing money on it.

There are honestly HUNDREDS of better businesses to put your money into. Think long term. Don't let the pandemic exclusively sway your decision on the stock choice you make. It may be around 6 more months, or 6 more years... Nobody knows.

Invest in a money that will thrive in 1, 5, 10+ years, regardless of the current global situation. These cruise companies, despite having a ton of cash, burn through a ton of it every month they are not out at sea. I've been working in travel for over 10 years (cruise for 4).

Honestly, at your age and with your experience, just invest in the US top 100, or better yet, so some basic research on the top 10/25, and invest your money into one of those. Some are presenting decent entry points at the moment, others are overvalued, but you'll still over the long term see much more positive (and reliable!) Outcomes than with your current strategy.

I'm sorry for your loss, but there were many exit signals that you didn't take because you were already invested in it. Best to learn when it's 4k instead of 40, or 400k.",1638270058,hmne6fu,t3_r4nakq,/r/StockMarket/comments/r4nakq/22_yrs_old_4k_loss/hmne6fu/,2,StockMarket,comment

The issue with people not getting vaccinated is that their sickness and deaths, in addition to the mutations that happen during that period, are **PREVENTABLE**.  These people are *choosing* to put us ALL at risk.

1451,red359,t2_5n6on,"You can compare the two here --&gt; https://etfdb.com/tool/etf-comparison/QQQM-SPLG/


QQQM has a higher expense ratio, but better performance most of the time (but not always)   QQQM has about 100 stocks, SPLG has about 500.  So QQQM is more focused on growth while taking on some risk.  While SPLG is spread out across more stocks and is less risky.


So how you handle these depends on your investing goals.  If you want a growth strategy, then a 80/20 or 70/30 split between QQQM/SPLG would be an option.  If you want a safer portfolio and are willing to miss out on a few percentage points of growth, then hold more SPLG.",1638168990,hmi6pmt,t3_r4p64h,/r/StockMarket/comments/r4p64h/should_i_buy_both_sp_500_and_nasdaq_etfs/hmi6pmt/,1,StockMarket,comment

1481,SnipahShot,t2_b509l,"Easy, because you know or think you know something that others don't.

Here is an example, I invested in Pfizer while it was rallying up to the Covid vaccine FDA approval. Sold it slightly before emotionally but still made about 7% overall.
After I bought back in, it continued to drop all the way down to 43 in 2 months.

I kept buying as I knew it had been working on a Covid treatment pill, I also knew it will do well in earnings.

The pill was a risk, but a risk I was willing to take. I didn't know when it will bottom so I just kept investing small amount.
Pfizer has broke its ATH twice in the last 2 weeks, even before the new variant (I didn't even consider it tbh). Currently I am up about 13% overall and over 20% from my lowest buy, in about a month.  
Don't know if it will go down today or not, but it will still rally up after the FDA approves the pill.

It isn't holding forever, but it is holding during a downtrend because you think the end of it is worth it.",1638172547,hmibeny,t1_hmhvsmu,/r/StockMarket/comments/r4nakq/22_yrs_old_4k_loss/hmibeny/,4,StockMarket,comment

1520,CasualCryptoInvestor,t2_gyapipmu,"You know this actually is a great example of why Warren Buffet isn't in crypto and he's too old and rich to care about learning a new technology. I realize that may at first glance appear as if I'm taking a shot at him, but it's referring to his talk about cryptocurrencies at shareholder meetings recently (and probably other things I haven't watched). I have the utmost respect for Warren Buffett - A true living legend, but this helps clarify why he's against the adoption of cryptocurrency. His simple lack of knowledge of it and the technology behind it spoken in his own words so many years ago. He actually probably wishes all of us crypto investors the best of luck, as he says in this video he doesn't care if people beat him to something if he doesn't understand it enough to properly valuate it.

1574,ElevatedAngling,t2_rz9pd,"No and mutations are kind of random but there are sequences that have higher rates of mutation. You can’t say where these mutations are but it’s more likely that they don’t effect the external structures as those are where the active sites and things that let the protein do it’s job and typically are good binding spots for antibodies. And on to the randomness of genetic mutation, I can’t give you a a degree in molecular biology in a comment as you don’t know anything about it but no statistically dna sequences that have higher numbers of A/T pairs over G/C pairs mutates easier as A/T only have 2 hydrogen bonds between them and makes them easier to “split” dna strands and has less intermolecular forces to interfere with an incorrect pairing. Now there are mutations that can occur on protein coding too but those are typically one off and not passes down during replication.

1599,DeepSkyAstronaut,t2_a25986i6,"I assume they applied for EUA with their interim data of 50% efficacy. So that's probably what the FDA will be primarily looking at. 

However, the huge drop implies in their second half of the trial the efficacy was around 10%. With a sample size this big it's really unlikely this is due to just statistical variations. It could be a sudden trend reversal due to delta, which would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless by now. 

Another possibility is they cherry picked a sub group of high risk people for their interim analysis. It would make sense since their orders with the US are conditional on EUA approval and they are gonna allow generic manufacturing in poorer countries anyways. In that case it could be granted EUA just for this subgroup, certainly though the FDA is not gonna simply ignore that if they did.

Molnupiravir's Mechnism of Action is basically mutating enough errors into the viral replication so that the replication fails. There is potentially the danger of mutating human DNA as well with unkown long term side effects. On top of that, new variants could evolve faster by this mutation accelerator. 

Merck's drug looks more and more like a very expensive and ineffective burden with unkown risks involved. My guess is Pfizer's Paxlovid will probably be the answer for high risk population as an antiviral agent and Bucillamine potentially the pill for standard risk population as an anti-inflammatory agent. Even combination of both will be considered since their MOAs work complementary.",1637988117,hm8maz7,t3_r34e4l,/r/StockMarket/comments/r34e4l/is_mrk_at_serious_risk_of_being_rejected_by_the/hm8maz7/,7,StockMarket,comment

1634,gly-rad,t2_4we1qkrc,"Isn’t it optimistic to think a recovery will occur within a week? If we assume the variant does spread, every day 1+ new country finds the variant, news fuels speculation, fear can still grip the markets. Under this assumption, buying now is a dangerous idea when we could be in the first stage of a new spread of unknown scale.

Best case scenario, the variant found has not started spreading widely and it would have to completely stall for a week or something and disappear for that level of optimism. Then, scientists would need to show reduced transmissibility and vaccine superiority against the virus. However, this usually takes weeks to discover and as of now, WHO seems to support the theory of this strain having higher chances of reinfection. As to lethality, it’s anyones guess but I’m praying it’s low. So again, buying now seems like a dangerous idea. Maybe at least wait it out till next Friday for better clarity on the situation.

Next there is the problem of debt and liquidity. The pandemic screwed the finances of cruises and the industry is on a lifeline. If this guillotine falls with ferocity, they may need another bailout that may or may not come.

For all we know this could be a repeat of late 2019-mid 2020. Air transport is already being curbed and it’s a stones throw away from sea transport.

“Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000.[20] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[21] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They sold the business later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.[22]”",1638006107,hm9bch5,t1_hm8mgae,/r/StockMarket/comments/r33hne/warren_buffett_investment_advice_for_beginners/hm9bch5/,3,StockMarket,comment

1783,Goddess_Peorth,t2_9uq0c3g8,"That's really cheap!

It closed at $3.45 ($345), they already made bank.

They must have bought that in the morning, before AMD went up.

It means nothing for tomorrow because their bet already paid off, $155+1.65=$156.65 and it closed at $157.80.

So even if you assume this person has a crystal ball, it is still meaningless. But if you watch the option chains, lots of people make last-minute bets like this and lose. There are a lot of $160 calls that could win tomorrow, but likely won't, and a lot of 165 and even 170 that are doomed. There will be about 2/3rds as many losing puts, too, assuming only small moves in the short session tomorrow. So these mini-bulls are winning, but options make bulls and bears into pigs.

There is a whole lot of 150 puts expiring in 3 weeks, but even more 160 calls, and 165 + 170 calls are also both big. Does it mean anything? More bulls than bears on AMD. I wouldn't bet on it either way; they're a great company, but their supply is limited beyond their control, and the shortages have hurt them. Their growth is limited by fab access. The stock price will not move based on the options chain. There are very few people buying options, and handing their money directly to the market-makers, compared to people buying and selling the stock.",1637905353,hm4he48,t3_r2evx7,/r/StockMarket/comments/r2evx7/any_big_brain_apes_out_there_care_to_shed_some/hm4he48/,6,StockMarket,comment

1835,j2866,t2_2w3n7x,"I am hoping that cooler heads prevail and they go slow with the tightening. There are many signs that they understand the following:
1) the current inflation is a supply problem, not a demand problem 
2) raising rates will make it a demand problem too. It will taking a moderate problem and making it a huge problem because now unemployment will be up and everything will still be expensive. More gov spending to help those who are struggling. 
3) the supply problem is mainly due to labor due to covid
4) covid impacts are transitory to some degree unless governments permanently make it easy to stay away from work (which would bother me but ultimately I’m fine with as long as rates stay low and assets stay up.. I can afford this inflation with the asset appreciation I have experienced)
5) much of the uproar is over price increases related every day items that either have complex supply chain routes or are impacted by domestic US labor. The gov should continue with targeted shots to address those items (think oil reserves)

Best outcome: Inflation cools as covid wanes. Low rates, strong demand and low unemployment through out. Use your asset gains to cover any permanent increases in pricing (and yes some of this is now driven by higher wages and is therefore permanent). US gets to continue to take advantage of prime position as the world reserve currency - backed by the most powerful military ever known to man and our massive financial markets and levels of consumption. We are only halfway through a demographic driven secular bull run.

Worst outcome: break the economy trying to fix inflation. Get stagflation. Domestic and global unrest accelerates, markets are crashed, unemployment high. Combo of much higher taxes,  and welfare programs or it goes the way of austerity. A civil or international war breaks out. The dollar goes into hyper inflation.

If it is just QQQ you gain 1% daily for 6 days and then lose 6% you end at $99.78 so almost break even.
