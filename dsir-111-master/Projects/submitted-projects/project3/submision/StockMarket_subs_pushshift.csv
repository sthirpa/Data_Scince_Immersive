*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.

* CCO (+13%)

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after ending last week on a strong note. We should be getting a monetary policy decision from the Fed later this week, which could cause some volatility. With inflation continuing to rise, they could be forced to act sooner rather than later. Jerome Powell has stated that the Fed will finish tapering sooner than initially planned, and we should get some clarity regarding this issue later this week. While data on the omicron variant is still limited, it appears to be more transmissible but cause less severe disease than the Delta variant. The only concern is potential lockdowns, but we seem to be in the clear for now.

SPY is trading a bit under 472. After a strong showing last week, we could see a push to fresh ATH. I'll be watching 470 as a potential support level. DIA is trading a bit over 360. I'll be watching that 360 level as potential support/resistance this morning. If it can hold over that level in today's trading, we could see a push to ATH as well. If we fail to hold over 360 support, we could retrace towards 356 support. QQQ is trading a bit under 400. I'll be watching 400 as a key resistance level. If we can break through and hold up over that level, I'll be watching for a push to fresh ATH. Gold is trading flat this morning, while silver is up a bit. Crude oil is down, but still holding over the $70 level. Bitcoin is currently trading around 48,400. Hovering around support levels, I'll be watching closely today as we could see some more weakness. I'll be watching around 47,000 as potential support. Ethereum is trading a bit under 4,000. I'll be watching the 3,900 level as potential support. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit in premarket trading. After failing to break back above previous support levels in last week's trading, we could be in for some more choppiness. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

The business since then improved but the shares are now trading at 21$.

With the strong branding and cheap valuation of an EV/Ebitda of 10, compared to Logitech at 14 and Apple, which is essentially also only a hardware company based on brand, with 23, it seems very attractive to me.

Also wanted to note that there are risks, like cloud computing, the end of lockdowns.. which can hurt this stock, but I am comfortable with investing in this company at these pricelevels.

As far as I understand this, when bond yield drop that is because investors are buying bonds. When investors buy bonds (more offer than demand) the price of the bond raises, therefore those bonds give lower yield if you purchase them at this value.

So why is anyone buying bonds when it is expected that the FED is going to announce a raise of interest rates sooner than expected this Wednesday? Can anyone explain this to me?

I want to buy her some stock in a company she likes as a Christmas gift just to get her into investing. I currently have an individual brokerage account with Etrade. I asked my parents to set up a custodial account for me when I was 15. I had full control of the account and they didn't have an Etrade account themselves. I transferred it to the individual account when I turned 21, not that anything really changed it was just so it was only in my name.

Is there a way I can set up a custodial account for my sister but have it attached to my account? I want to be able to fund the account to buy the first stock and be able to look at it until it gets transferred over into her name when she is older. However, I don't want her to be able to see my account balance if that makes sense. Could there possibly be two logins? One for my account to be able to see both, and one for her just to see her account? Or would it just be easier to set up a completely separate custodial account as my parents did for me?

As inflation picks up, we already know the FED will have to increase interest rates. The question is - how do we invest with this in mind? I’ve been questioning this for months now. 

I’ve heard two theories. The first states that inflation is no real concern for the stock market in general, in fact it states it’s actually good for the stock market. 

The second theory states that as inflation rises there tends to be an inverse relationship to stock market growth, and specifically company P/E ratios. Growth stocks tend to lose ground as P/E ratios come back down to earth. 

I tend to believe the second theory as it makes more sense to me. Low interest rates and easy money for the past decade have fueled a magnificent bull run. As rates go up, and money tightens, I believe we’ll likely see a pullback or correction in the market. To what extent? I do not know. 

So what do we do with this information? Which stocks or sectors do well during inflationary increases? From my research it’s been energy, oil, commodities, and gold. Will this trend prove to be true once again?

Unfortunately, we are facing a crisis where they don't want to slow down printing today. It is getting out of hand and becoming dangerous to the lower and middle class workers of the USA. You may feel excited that your getting paid more but pay attention to the consequences and the wealth gap. (or better yet read the article!)

&amp;#x200B;

 It is directly from the St.Louis FED written in 2009 when they did have to cover up for printing trillions of dollars, enjoy!:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Money is obviously a vital part of an economy because it allows trade to  occur more efficiently. Governments have a great power that no one else  in the economy has—the ability to print money. Thus, the government can  acquire more goods by printing more money, a process known as  seigniorage. This power, however, brings with it a dangerous temptation.  Imagine that you had this power; just think of what you could do with  it! You could live a great life, feed the hungry and house the homeless.  And all of this could be achieved simply by printing more money. This  sounds wonderful. How can it be dangerous? 

If the government prints too much money, people who sell things for  money raise the prices for their goods, services and labor. This lowers  the purchasing power and value of the money being printed. In fact, if  the government prints too much money, the money becomes worthless. We  have seen many governments give in to this temptation, and the result is  a hyperinflation. Hyperinflations were observed in the 20th century in  Germany (twice), Hungary, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, with Zimbabwe as  the most recent casualty. Such episodes of high inflation can greatly  impair the functioning of the economy or collapse it altogether. Thus,  having the power to print money brings with it great responsibility to  respect that power. 

It is important to remember that the temptation to print money is not  restricted to less-developed countries. In fact, the United States has  suffered from high inflation several times. In pre-revolutionary days,  many colonies had the right to print money and fell prey to their own  excesses. The Continental Congress did the same during the Revolutionary  War. In 1775, it gave the colonies the authority to issue Continental  dollars to finance the war. Overissuance and counterfeiting by the  British led to such dramatic increases in paper currency that by 1779,  the value of a Continental dollar was 1/25th of its original value  (giving rise to the phrase ""not worth a continental""). During the Civil  War, the Confederate government also succumbed to the temptation of  printing money to buy goods. From 1861 to 1864, the stock of Confederate  dollars increased 10-fold, and prices increased the same. Financing  government spending via the printing press also occurred in the 20th  century. Shortly after the founding of the Federal Reserve, the U.S.  Treasury adopted policies that induced the Fed to monetize government  debt.**1** This led to a spike in U.S. inflation  following World War I. These examples show that the U.S. government has  a history of resorting to the printing press to pay for government  expenditures. 

Most governments have taken steps to discipline themselves and impose  restraints on their ability to print money to pay for goods. A  time-honored method of restraint was to tie the value of the currency to  a commodity such as gold. Because the government did not control gold  production, the amount of money it could print was limited by its  holdings of gold. Although this restrained the government's ability to  create seigniorage, it also unfortunately tied its hands during periods  of high demand for currency, such as financial crises (a time in which  people wanted to hold the government's currency rather than other  assets) or during planting season (a time in which farmers needed cash  to pay for seed, etc.). Other problems also occurred: New gold  discoveries, such as during the California gold rush, led to an inflow  of gold and new currency issue, which caused inflation. Conversely, if  the economy grew faster than the supply of gold, then prices of goods  and services would fall, leading to deflation. Finally, it is very  costly to mine gold simply to hold it in storage to back up pieces of  paper money. For these reasons and others, governments began to realize  that using a gold standard to control the nation's money supply was too  restrictive and costly. 

As a result, governments slowly moved to a fiat currency system, one in  which the money was not backed by a commodity but rather by the ""full  faith and credit"" of the government. Under such a system, the government  promises its citizens that it will discipline itself and not resort to  seigniorage to finance government spending. In short, citizens have to  trust that the government will do the right thing. But trust can be  abused; therefore, the citizenry demanded institutional arrangements  that backed up the government's pledge. 

That is why most governments took steps to tie their own hands and make  themselves credible stewards of their nation's economic interests. It  became very clear that if elected government officials had direct  control of the money supply, then they could cut taxes and print money  to pay for goods to win votes. Consequently, promises by elected  officials would not be seen as credible. To achieve credibility and  avoid this abuse of public power for private gain, the control of the  money supply had to be delegated to a nonelected group of individuals.  These officials were to run the institution responsible for monetary  policy, known as the ""central bank."" It was important that central  bankers be independent of the political process to ensure that they  could not be manipulated by elected officials. However, having such  great power meant that central bankers had to be accountable to the  electorate in some fashion, and accountability required the central bank  to behave in a transparent manner. Thus a well-designed central bank  needed to be 1) credible, 2) independent, 3) accountable and 4)  transparent.",StockMarket,2009 - Truth when the FED did not have to cover up for tremendous money printing,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsusl1/2009_truth_when_the_fed_did_not_have_to_cover_up/,True,submission

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.

# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he’s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
&gt; # Chain store earnings
&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
&gt; “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
&gt; “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. “I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,” he said.

&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

&gt; Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

[Mitigating Anxiety is Mitigating the Unknown, and Mitigating the Unknown is Mitigating Downside Risk](https://preview.redd.it/p7iethoi3fz71.jpg?width=3907&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0576d1b2c223bce6cb25dbb3e47bcdc661b5fe4a)

**Overview:** For those of you who consider yourself seasoned traders, ignore this... although I promise you that you will learn something. For those of you who have anxiety issues I think this will prove to be an invaluable resource. I'm going to put a lot of time into writing this and it is directed at those who have high amounts of anxiety while trading in the markets. 

# Reddit is an Enabler of Trading Anxiety: 

Back in the day I used to post a metric ton of highly detailed DD on Reddit. I posted my research on Reddit for a simple reason ... I wanted feedback ... I wanted to crowdsource my DD. One of the predominant issues I continued to run into was few, if any, added any substantive value in the comment section. I would post DD and 2-4 weeks later I would get a flood of comments of folks who never commented on the thread before, but nevertheless tanked me for all the money they made as a result of reading and taking action on a ticker I wrote about. It was then I noticed that people on Reddit are frequently looking for justification to throw money at anything that may bring them a decent return. As it turned out the information I posted provided that justification. But this was not the reason I posted the research. Once again, I wanted to crowd source DD.

I stopped posting DD on Reddit altogether. It was a lot of work for too little feedback. I can do a complete deep dive &amp; workup on a company in my head with a pad and pencil within an hour. Putting it all together and posting it takes considerably more time. I realized that there is a large segment of people wanted to be told what to invest in with a detailed summary as to why. They generally want to know  the risks, they want to know the possible rewards, and they wanted to know when to buy in, average down, and sell. I therefore opted instead to publish a daily newsletter instead of positing on Reddit. 

People on Reddit are buying what they don't understand from people they ought not to trust. A great deal of DD on Reddit only comes about when some poor fella is bag holding deep and suddenly realizes that he/she wants to share the amazing value with the world under a misguided understanding that they may be able to generate undue interest in the stock. DD on Reddit is bag holders paradise. Remember more recently when SNAP, WISH, or PTON dumped on very poor earnings? Did you happen to notice all the DD that was posted days to weeks after? Those were bag holders folks. In part, their anxiety from their losses led them to the desperation of taking to Reddit to pitch trash. 

Reddit is a trash heap of poorly written ""DD"" and bad advice. For every solid bit of analysis found on reddit there are thousands of poorly written items that are neither ""due"" nor ""diligent."" How much ""DD"" have you seen posted, for example, with absolutely no consideration for the risk factors? If they're missing a risk section can we honestly say they're being ""diligent"" ... or are they just trying to pump a stock? And there are plenty of new retail traders who have absolutely no clue what they're doing for these fellas to prey on. 

There is a reasons so many new retail traders are taking to Reddit for answers. Reddit has received a lot of attention in the media as a result of the GME/AMC fiasco. So new retail traders see Reddit as a place to look for guidance, but instead of guidance, they end up looking for profit in a sea of bad advice. Many are new to the market, they do not know how to read the financials, they do not know how to assess economic conditions, and they do not know how to read/assess (or even find) 10-K's, 10-Q's, 8-K's, earnings calls, etc... They do not know how to value a company, how to identify entry &amp; exit points, how to assess debt,  how to conduct competitive analysis and some even think technical analysis is all you need. They do not know how to assess trailing PE, forward PE, PB, BVPS, PEG, current ratios, PS, Enterprise Value, GAAP EPS, NON GAAP EPS, operating margin, and the list goes on &amp; on &amp; on. And even if they could somewhat do all of this, they don't have the time. So what's the result? ... Massive amounts of confusion, massive amounts of ignorance, and massive amounts of the fear of the unknown.

# Fear of the Unknown is the Number One Reason for Trader Anxiety: 

The reason that most of you  suffer from trading anxiety is a lack of confidence in your picks which leads to a great deal of fear of the unknown. And there is only one way to eliminate the fear of the unknown. ELEMINATE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE UNKNOWN. And if you're are trying to eliminate the unknown through scrolling through insufficient DD posts on reddit, then your anxiety will likely be amplified when you suddenly find out that most of your trades will fail. 

# Eliminating the Unknown will Eliminate Anxiety: 

Before I retired, I spent 8 years in the Marines as an Infantryman and 13 years in the Army as an intelligence analyst. I've been on the receiving end of information and the production end of information. I've seen the horrible results of bad information, and the absolutely amazing successes in good information. In my experience analysis should overwhelmingly be risk based. Assessing and mitigating risk in my former line of work meant an increased likelihood of mission success, friendly lives saved, and civilian lives saved. The less risk you assess the higher the threat, and therefore, the higher the anxiety. I approach trading in the same fashion. And I know from experience the largest risks come from the unknowns. Learning to identify and spot those unknowns comes largely from experience but you need to begin somewhere. There are 3 types of unknowns. 

* **Known Unknows:** These are the items you know you do not know. The overwhelming amount of your effort when assessing an equity is dedicated to filling in the gaps of those items you know you do not know, but would like to know. And much of it is easy to find, but what if you can't? There are many cases in which you would like to know something but the information is not available. In those cases you look for indicators of the information requirements you need to make your case.
* **Unknown Knowns:** These are things you know, but either forgot you knew, or failed to apply it to your analysis. To remedy this you simply need to critically think about what you know and how it applies to your analysis.
* **Unknown Unknowns:** This is perhaps the most dangerous, as it is ALMOST completely derived from ignorance. The more ignorant we are on a certain subject matter the more we run into unknown unknowns. Once you've started on your known knowns, identified your known unknowns (and their indicators), assessed your unknown knowns, you draw your attention to the unknown unknowns. Essentially this is asking ""what the hell am I missing and where can I go to find it,"" or ""where can I look to find the things I do not know I'm missing?""

# Eliminating the Unknown and Mitigating Anxiety: 

Investing first and researching later is no way to go about business and it can greatly increase your anxiety! The more you know about your company and the current and future economic conditions, the less anxiety you will have. 

* **Assessing the Know Knowns:** When you begin your analysis you will always start with assessing what you know. You know, that no matter what company you're looking at, you will generally want the following:
   * A forward PE (Price to Earnings) that is lower than the trailing PE, unless you think the market forward PE consensus is wrong. 
   * A PE that is relatively lower than sector/industry peers unless you are expecting massive growth.
   * A BV (Book Value) and BVPS (Book Value Per Share) that is closer to the market cap/share price as possible as compared to industry peers.
   * A PS (Price to Sales) ratio of one or less (ideally less than industry/sector peers) of unless, once again, you're expecting massive future growth. 
   * A PEG (Price to Earnings Growth) ratio of one or less unless you are pricing in massive growth (Few if any tech companies have a PEG ratio less than one).
   * An enterprise value that is near, or higher than, market cap. Unless, once again, you are expecting massive growth. Companies that have a enterprise value significantly lower than market cap can be possible buyout opportunities. 
   * Manageable debt relatively lower than industry peers. (A current ratio above 1 but lower than 5)
   * The company can pay their dividend (see payout ratio) 
   * A solid amount of cash on hand.
   * Moderate to high amounts of institutional investment.
   * A solid and growing operating cash flow and operating margin.
   * Increasing YoY Quarterly Revenue Growth and YoY Quarterly EPS Growth.
   * Trading at a value on a pullback of no negative consequence.
   * Solid forward guidance
   * A history of insider confidence through insider buying
   * Solid buy rating analyst coverage and upgrades (Take it with a grain of salt, there are more shitty analysts out there than stars in the sky). 
   * Share buybacks are always nice
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Company:** You can never eliminate all the unknowns about the company. But you can ask yourself the following:
   * Is the company at risk for an offering?
   * Can future revenues cover additional debt and reinvestment?
   * What are the chances the company does not preform as expected? 
   * How critical will it be for my investment if the company misses EPS projections? Its an important question to ask. Companies underperform EPS all the time amid earnings. More often than not it means the company is still growing, just not at the rate analysts expected. For most profitable companies, missing EPS projections does NOT mean the company isn't profitable. Companies with a positive EPS should typically be better off this quarter on the books than the previous quarter. 
   * Is the company's goals realistic and obtainable?
   * Is the company under or over shooting projected guidance?
   * Are analysts under or over shooting guidance?
   * Is the space the company competes in overcrowded?
   * Is the company losing or gaining market share as compared to competitors?
   * Does the company have a competitive advantage or disadvantage?
* **Eliminating Unknowns About the Current and Future Economic Conditions:** This can be tough but at minimum you should study current and [upcoming economic datasets](https://tradingeconomics.com/) and ask how a positive or negative change in the various categories affects your company. You will also want to come up with your own short, medium, and long term projection of economic conditions and how they will affect your company. Always pay attention to the [economic calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/)!
   * Inflation Rate (Low is good for preventing dramatic shifts in personal spending, high id good for paying off long term debt)
   * Semiconductor Shortage
   * Worker Shortage (Can they meet demand with the workers they got? If not can they beat previous quarters EPS with the workers they got?)
   * Supply Chain Bottlenecks (Check their domestic inventories as a solid indicator of how affected they are by this)
   * Rising fuel and Energy Costs
   * Rising Shipping Costs
   * Government &amp; Regulatory Environment
   * Federal Reserve Policy
   * Reliance on China and Chinese Economic/Regulatory Environment
   * Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate (Too high less people are buying, too low and the cost of labor goes up)
   * Always Pay Close Attention to the [ECONOMIC CALANDER](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qsubyk/next_weeks_economic_calendar_1115202111222021/) and the results reported!

# Perspective and Expectation Management Also Mitigates Anxiety:

It's gonna go to the moooooon!!!! No it isn't! Read my part on Big money below to find out why. It's important that you have reasonable expectations. It's important that you have a decent and realistic perspective on the outcome of your trade. Doing this will go leaps and bounds toward mitigating your anxiety. 

* **There is NO Such thing as a Perfect Stock:**  If your anxiety is so through the roof that you're forgoing great trades on good companies, cut that shit out! There is no such thing as a perfect stock and you will always need to accept a certain degree of risk! 
* **Do not Sweat Minor Misses in EPS:** You're company barely missed analysts EPS or Revenue Expectations? So what!!?? Are they profitable? Are they growing? If they had positive revenue or EPS, chances are they're still growing on the books. Sure their rate of growth may have changed but they're adding money to the balance sheet! It would be one thing if they lowered guidance, but short of that a small EPS miss isn't nothing to frown upon and might put you in the position to buy some more stock for a cheaper price on a really good company! If holding a little longer gives you anxiety then its because you're attempting to get money quick by swinging trades, which is fine, but can add an additional layer of anxiety. 
* **Expect the Unexpected and Have a Plan:** Black Swans happen. Major unexpected economic shifts happen. Your dry bulk carrier will catch fire or lose their cargo in the ocean. Oil companies will have spills. Companies get sued all the time. Adjusted economic numbers come out every day of the week. Your stock WILL NOT trade as everyone expects it to. Get used to this and you will mitigate your anxiety. Buy in slowly and have a plan, and you will mitigate it even more. 
* **Analysts are Always Wrong:** Firstly it is important to understand that analyst price targets are where the analyst expects the stock to be in a year or so. Not right now. I see a lot of retail traders complaining about the company share price not being at the analyst price target. Its ridiculous expectation management!
* **Understand how Big Money Operates and Expect their Antics!:**  When large institutions dealing in millions to billions of dollars decide to buy or sell a stock, they are well aware that they will inevitably move the share price. The volume they create can be massive. To mitigate this they will either sell calls or buy puts when they sell a considerable lot of shares, or buy calls or sell puts when they buy a considerable lot of shares. Therefore it is important to understand that institutions can often make money no matter which way the stock trades. Unlike most retail traders they even have the option to go both long &amp; short on the same security at the same time. They can, &amp; do, often go short to take advantage of the bearish sentiment they inevitably create while selling large blocks of shares while locking in their profit using a combination of options strategies. Always remember that retail does not own the market … big money does. This reality forces us to come to grips with the necessity not to fight them, but to ride their backs. This includes having the discipline &amp; courage of our convictions to hold through the bearish sentiment institutions inevitably create, on perfectly good companies, when some big firm takes profit. Consider retail traders like ourselves the small Remora Fish attached to a large Great White Shark (The Institutions), waiting to ride their backs out of but a temporary rut of no true consequence. 
* **Trading Psychology:** Psychology plays a large part of why stocks can continue to trade below street value. Once a stock sells off due to large institutional profit taking, the street wonders why. Does someone know something we don’t? Was there some economic data that cast bearish sentiment on this particular industry or sector? Does the street expect the company to act in a way that will lower its valuation? Such questions, &amp; many more, aren’t just asked by us. They’re asked by everyone who holds a position in the company we do. Even analysts may downgrade a stock for no other reason than to tailor their expectations a year out from now. Indeed they hate to be wrong, &amp; they always are. So do not be surprised not only when a security we thought was already undervalued sells off further than expected, but also stays down as it may take time for traders to feel comfortable entering again. Corrections back to street value can often take a few weeks to a few months. Sometimes until next earnings to relive fears of both retail &amp; large institutions. 

# Processes Mitigate Anxiety:

Processes mitigate anxiety. The more efficient the process the less time you spend searching for places to put that money that's burning a hole in your pocket. Some traders feel as though they are in a rush to hurry up and strike while the iron is hot and put their money somewhere only to find out that  they rushed their trades and realized a loss. Below is my process and a few additional pointers for researching equities and it mitigates A LOT of my personal trader anxiety. 

1. **Assess the Economic Conditions First!:** Assessing the economic conditions first grants you the opportunity to single out those sectors that stand to benefit the most from current and future economic conditions. If you do not know how to do this please see an earlier post I made on this very topic [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qrtkox/understanding_and_profiting_from_our_current/). Also investing in companies that stand to benefit the most from economic conditions gives you an extra layer of confidence to fight anxiety. 
2. **Make a Price Based Assessment Watchlist and Set your Alerts:** A Price Based Assessment Watchlist is simply adding companies that you've 1. Assessed the Current or Future Economic Conditions as Favorable. 2. Done a Quick Review of the [Company Financials](https://stocktipstips.substack.com/p/stocktips-investment-research-series). 3. Set your alert at your desired reassessment price. ONLY when that alert hits is when you do the rest of your research and DD. That way you ONLY use your valuable time on the most promising of circumstances. That way you aren't frantically searching and scrolling for plays, but letting the plays come to you, which helps with anxiety!
3. **Buy on a Pullback of Little to No Negative Consequence:** I love a good dump. Perhaps it comes from a bad market day, perhaps it comes from the sector in general doing poorly that day, and perhaps it comes from a whale taking profit. I don't care. If the financials are great, I expect them to grow, and the economic conditions are favorable, such a pullback will trigger my buy alerts letting me know its time for a starter position. But first I do a quick assessment to see if there is any recent negative news that is driving down the share price. If there is negative news, I ask myself to what degree is the news of legitimate financial substance to the growth prospects of the company. If very little, I'll be happy to buy that dip. Some would argue that they want to jump in on solid relative strength. Yeah ... they're chasing and I don't chase. I like it when its cold, not when its hot. Later, when my thesis becomes true, then it gets hot and I watch everyone else chase. But buying on a pullback of little to no consequence will give you that extra layer of value and security you may have been looking for. You wont be worried if the security is over pumped and about to fall, but rather patiently waiting for it to pump again. I think the latter of the two holds less anxiety. More profitable too!
4. **Keep Track of the News:** If you want to monitor your investments stop looking at the chart and read all the news that comes out on your company. Two good places to do this are seeking alpha (Put the ticker in and click the news tab) and, believe it or not, StockTwits! The bots and the news scroller on StockTwits are money! Ignore the people there, read the news scroller! Also set prices you want to review 5% above or below your starter position price and program your broker app to alert you when they hit those points. Its a lot more easy to go about your day that way, and waaay less anxiety when you can be rest assured that at minimum you have lost too much. 

# Anxiety Mitigating Rules to Live by:

Some added anxiety killing tips!

* **If you aren't willing to hold the stock long term, stay away from it!:** So you think you're going to swing it real quick and get out so you don't need to put too much effort into the trade? Think again. The technical analysis guru on YouTube may have a pretty set up, but he's going to throw your anxiety through the roof. And only IF you're lucky, you MAY make a profit. 
* **Quit Checking your Phone, Set Alerts Instead:** Set share price points where you want to be alerted and quit checking your phone. I promise you that your anxiety is really going to increase when you're fired from work because you spend too much time checking your investments and too little time getting anything done. 
* **Stay Away from Risky Options Strategies:** So you wanted to get rich quick so you bough a bunch of naked calls or puts? All or nothing baby!! Well there goes your anxiety. The more professional you are with options the less anxiety you'll have.
* **Be a Net Options Seller:** Covered calls while you're waiting for your position to turn over long periods of time is a great idea. Its like getting a free dividend and it lowers your cost basis. I've been selling POWW calls for the last three months and in addition to profiting from the increase in share price, I've cashed in $0.56 in premium per share, an 9% gain on the overall position on options premium alone. At this point I don't care how the stock trades. Talk about low anxiety huh? I'll sell calls till the cows come home and if the shareprice on the last day before expiry is slightly over the strike on the calls I sold, pending I want to hold on to the shares I'll just roll the options to another month for additional premium. Furthermore when I can't get a stock for the price I want I often just sell an in the money cash secured put if the options premium is worth it. Lets say a stock is trading for $6.00 but the $7.50 strike put is trading for $2.70. That means the real price to me if assigned is $4.80 per share. Talk about a steal! I'll sell that contract all day every day! And with practically no anxiety. 
* **Don't buy in all at once, do NOT chase!:** Don't just throw in a full allocation all at once on a stock. Rather establish a starter position and buy in slowly in the red. This will greatly lower your cost average and increase your profitability. For example, if you established a starter position but now you find yourself down 5%, you can just buy an equally sized position and now you only need the stock to increase 2.5% to recover from your loss. Does this help with your anxiety? You bet it does! Finally, if the stock skyrockets don't chase it. Enjoy the profit and move on. Chasing has been the windowmaker of plenty of traders ... particularly in the penny stock world. 
* **Stay away from unprofitable companies and Penny Stocks:** This speaks for itself. I have analyzed a the risk on a bunch of penstocks. And unprofitable companies can often disappoint. Indeed the volatility is there, and there is profit to be made amid volatility. However trust me when I tell you that if you are reading this, it means you likely need help in your trading habits, and you should just stay away from penny stocks and unprofitable companies. 
* **BUY RELIABLY RPOFITABLE COMPANIES PRIMED FOR GROWTH, TRADING AT A SECTOR RELATIVE VALUE, ON A PULLBACK OF NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE, WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT, UNDER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS!:** Swing for grand slams and you'll strike out, or ground out nearly every time. Swing for base hits and you'll hit base hits, home runs, and grand slams on a very regular basis!

# You will NEVER Get Rid of All of your Anxiety:

Its got to be said! You will never get rid of all of your anxiety. You just put a significant amount of cash you worked hard for into shares of a company subject to both positive and negative market forces. There will always be unknowns. Therefore, there will always be anxiety. 

**TL;DR:** First, I HIGHLY suggest you read this if you fee that you are the target audience. The thesis above speaks to the fact that anxiety in trading largely comes from the unknown, &amp; the more you mitigate the unknown the less anxiety you will experience. Above there are plenty of steps you can do to mitigate the unknown, thereby developing your confidence, and become a more profitable trader. I also argue that you can mitigate a large portion of your anxiety simply by understanding what you're buying in an equity, understand the markets, understanding trading techniques, developing a sense of perspective, and buying ""*reliably profitable companies, primed for growth, trading a sector relative value, on pullback of little to no negative consequence, with a decent amount of institutional investment, under favorable economic conditions.*"" This post is for people serious about mitigating their anxiety and learnings how to trade in a manner that will benefit both their mental health and their wallets. In summary, if traders respect their own money and do what they're supposed to do, it will go a long way to mitigating anxiety.

----

And I think the benefits of this could be enhanced even further by reforming the public company share trade system entirely with nontradable, appreciating earning shares, which are bought back and reissued with adjusted prices and appreciation rate, by the company quarterly, if a holder decides to bail, or if the offered dividends have been paid. All required capital for growth can be sourced this way, continuously, as desired, cutting out the bank middleman for loans, while receiving healthy market based pressure instead of the cumbersome and often toxic influence from shortterm gambler- and hostile shareholders. Plus, the objectivity of the capital market would be vastly improved.

Director of AT &amp; T just bought 2,5 mil worth of shares. Mostly there are many reason for insider to sell but only one reason to buy.

If we look at T performance history it mainly go sideways with periods of underperforming and outperforming which looks to me almost like cyclical stock. Can management changes lead to T outperforming time ?

Personally i would not hold T stock forever but rather consider it as ,, longer term trade,,. By valuation metrics and analyst price target of 30.5 dollars it can look interesting. Also there is nice dividend which will be cut in 2022 i think it is already priced in as this is no news.

Invesco commissioned Economist Impact to conduct a survey on the allocation of global investors in China. Between June and July this year, it collected the opinions of senior investment experts from global investment institutions on their investment allocation in China.

The interviewees covered 200 asset owners (including pension and sovereign funds, banks and insurance companies, etc.) in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, with assets under management ranging from US$500 million to US$100 billion.

Among them, **85% of the interviewees said that they had increased or maintained their allocation in China** in the past 12 months, and 64% expected to increase their holdings in the next 12 months; only 12% of the interviewees said they expected to reduce their holdings.

In addition, **60% of the interviewees still expect China's economic situation to be better than that of the world in the next 12 months.**

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures rise after S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

&gt; * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting revealed a “gradual tapering process” of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. Bitcoin was up around $58,000. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

&gt; # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

Throughout the month of September, Allied ground crews were focusing their efforts at the Gilmer Lease site and on wells number 1, 2, and 5, specifically. Since October 11, 2021, Allied is pleased to report that these three wells have been pumping and producing both oil and natural gas. Representatives of Allied Energy has identified a regional natural gas purchasing company and are presently working on securing a Gas Purchase Agreement.

The Annie Gilmer lease is a 300 acre site in the small community of Crystal Falls, Texas on the banks of the Clear Fork of the Brazos river, approximately thirty miles north of the town of Breckenridge, Texas. There were six wells drilled on the lease starting in the mid 70’s with the last being drilled in 1989.

CEO George Montieth commented: ""I am pleased with the progress at the Gilmer Lease location. Three wells have been reworked and re-completed and are now back in production. Allied has reached an important milestone in that we have achieved initial oil production at two of our lease locations. We have two wells producing at the Green Lease and three wells producing at the Gilmer Lease.”

Allied project manager, Curtis Boyles, will be on the ground at the Prometheus Lease focusing attention on well H-1 (please see last press release). Allied is committed to consistent updates that convey our corporate progress at this exciting new lease location.

Data: JPMorgan reached earnings of $3.74 per share and revenue hit $30.4 billion, both were better than analyst projections.

The Good: Equities trading revenue topped $2.5 billion, a strong performance that was better than what was expected.

The Bad: The company’s fixed-income revenue decreased 20%, which hurt the overall earnings.

Quote: “JPMorgan Chase delivered strong results as the economy continues to show good growth - despite the dampening effect of the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions.” - Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and CEO.

Bigger Picture: Several other big banks are expected to report their earnings today. How will the other banks perform when compared to JPMorgan’s earnings?

Final Thoughts: JPMorgan recently increased its dividend yield.

In this post I will discuss why owning shares in Beam Global not only adds balance to but also maximizes your exposure in the EV race to the future. I will briefly touch on fundamentals, technicals, and why I think this ticker has such a promising future to become not only a short squeeze ticker, but also a great long-term investment that can be held with high conviction. In light of so many highly shorted companies with no real value or growth trajectories being targeted and pumped around wall street, I think it is important to find companies with real fundamental value or future growth so that retail players have the option to not treat every new WSB post as simply a trade. In my opinion, BEEM offers some of this security to hold with conviction, thus making the odds of a short squeeze that much higher. While the “short-squeeze” market becomes ever-so-saturated and spread out among retail players, the odds that your short-squeeze ticker gets dumped for the next new shiny squeeze is increasing. With BEEM, one may find that holding this company for its fundamental value, and not just technicals alone is certainly a great option.

Fundamentals:

We are in early innings of the EV infrastructure race and 10's-100's of millions of charging stations need to be built worldwide. When one thinks of who will bring EV charging to the world, undoubtedly $CHPT &amp; $BLNK come to mind. Although these two companies will most likely become prominent EV charging stations, $BEEM offers a different business model that can offer reliable sustained growth and exposure to this sector. Next, I will offer some insight into the tailwinds this company has going for it, why it not only differs from the CHPT/BLNK business model, but also compliments the portfolio by having both:

Sentiment- Market sentiment towards solar and EV charging companies has been beaten down the last couple months, and is reflected in most of the SP's of solar/ev charging. While market sentiment has been at all-time lows for this sector, the sentiment surrounding climate change is reaching extreme levels. Headlines surrounding climate change, increasing catastrophe around the world, migration, and carbon neutrality are all picking up as new climate reports are starting to come out. EV charging is not an IF, but a WHEN, and I see this EV charging/solar sell-off as a buying opportunity whether as a trade or LT investment.

Proof of Concept: BEEM offers a growth trajectory that has been proved in concept with its acquisition of Gov't Contracts, City Contracts, Military Contracts and Customer Feedback. Initially, most of these contracts are somewhat small in scope, but open the door not only domestically, but internationally as well to increased partnerships in laying down the EV charging infrastructure needed to make global EV's possible. In 2021 alone, BEEM has been awarded close to 20 new contracts and partnerships with cities, colleges, and military bases around the US, all of which has flown under the radar. Countless cities and states have had a competitive bidding process for these contracts, and BEEM was the only vendor with the right solution. This is because BEEM offers solutions to the EV charging space that no other company is really addressing right now. I see BEEM as being somewhat the PLTR of the EV charging race, increasingly scooping up government contracts, and thus benefiting most from the infrastructure bill. In June, BEEM was also added into the Russell.

Patents: BEEM boasts not only many great patents, but also has a focus on R&amp;D and advancing its tech. Their patents include Tracking Sun, Generating Power, Storing Power etc. In a recent interview, the CEO has also alluded to upcoming new products coming soon. This offers a speculation that some good PR will be right around the corner.

Business Model: The crux of their business model offers the following advantages over its competition: Cost Reduction- Permits, digging, electrical, labor, and all unforeseen costs that come with it. BEEM’s business model avoids all these troubles with their charging solutions. These volatile and variable costs cannot be understated enough when talking EV charging at scale. BEEM charging units immediately begin to pay themselves: reduction in construction/labor costs, free charging from sun and this positively impacts business models that can thus be enabled. Volatility from the underlying cost of electricity, volatility from installation costs is all avoided. Imagine cranking out millions of sustainable EV charging units, and not having to dig anything, get any permits, hire any laborers, deal with any delays etc.

Footprint Reduction: No further need of electricity, energy comes from sun. A more efficient way to become carbon neutral. Increasingly advancing tech YoY that’s becoming more efficient. While there may certainly be demand for fast charging, let’s not forget the ultimate goals we are trying to accomplish here, sustainability, low carbon footprint, detachment from any kind of power grid.

Time Reduction: 4 minutes deployable overnight, no construction, no permitting, no contracting. Most scalable, fastest deployable, standard EV charging solution. This is another tailwind that cannot be emphasized enough. This ultimately allows Beam to capture so many different addressable markets. In NYC, 24 months of permitting, planning, digging etc. is needed to put on in the ground. BEEM can fill demand faster than anyone else. They are durable and last a long time and can be put anywhere.

Competition: BLNK, CHPT. However, BEEM does not really consider these companies as competitors though. BEEM already works with CHPT charging solutions. BEEM has the ability to dominate different addressable markets that CHPT/BLNK cannot. BEEM ""supports all other EV charging companies"". Companies like CHPT boast fast charging, however BEEM doesn’t think of EV charging like gas stations but placed in locations you’re going to already. They focus on daily range replenishment and this is what they are going for, not cross country traveling. BEEM is trying to change the way we think about fueling our vehicles and detaching from the gas station.

Valuation: BEEM is trading at a 225M market cap and offers some of the cheapest entry points to EV charging, thus offering some of the best growth possible in the sector. They have basically no debt, and the CEO is a strong leader and salesman who knows what he’s doing, and cares about his shareholders. While BEEM has been dominating domestic contracts, the CEO has said they are ready to start taking on the European/international market. With this strong fundamental backdrop, it is of my opinion that this is 100% not a ‘meme-stock”, not a pump and dump, but more speculative play that EV infrastructure will see exponential growth in the future. With that being said, let’s get into some technicals and why I think this ticker could have a massive short squeeze, if volume was there.

Technicals:

So, fundamentals aside, what makes this ticker such a great candidate for the WSB infamous “short-squeeze”. Clearly posting tickers with high short interest is a dubious way to pick short squeezes. BEEM checks many boxes that gives it such promise to become one.

1. Micro-Float. Float: 7.5M shares. A low float enables extremely volatile moves to both sides. When the sector heats up, and volume comes back, the move BEEM can make is potentially very large. When EV was hot, this ticker made a move from 10-75$ in just a couple of months. I like to compare this ticker to TeeKAT with a similar float that made a huge move based off hype.
2. Institutional Ownership: BEEM has a VERY high share allocation held by institutions. You don’t see this as often with many of the new “meme-stocks”, because well, they are meme stocks. There are 156 tutes, 142 long only, 3 short only, 11 long/short. Ownership by tutes makes of 65% of BEEM.
3. Short Interest: 37%, with 23 days to cover those positions. A pump here could wreak havoc on these shorts with how hard it will be for them to cover these positions. It should be noted that this stock is quite illiquid right now, also increasing the likelihood that a move here would be quite dramatic, to both sides. They have any easy time keeping it pinned on low-liquidity, but if we saw a dramatic increase in volume, we could see a dramatic price increase as well.

# 1) 1929, 1987, 2000, and NOW... are the PARABOLIC RISE / BLOW-OFF chart patterns that stand out from all the other more gradually rising bull markets. 

2) **These market environments have much in common :** **Multi-year bull markets that culminated in near vertical rises... In which investor sentiment near the end was rabid... Near the end, investors simply did not believe they could lose.**

**A) the crash of ’29 was only the first phase of an 85% decline into ’32**

**B) the crash of 1987, created relatively low Shiller PE multiple, so that was the end. Interestingly the** charts from both periods were eerily similar, **a pattern noticed and famously exploited by Paul Tudor Jones, who traded both the rise and the crash in 1987 with great success.**

**C) The crash of tech stocks in March 2000 led to a total loss of about 80% when the bottom was finally hit in late 2002. The Shiller PE was the highest ever recorded in history = Why stocks declined almost as much as they had from 1929 to 1932**

(NASDAQ: DATS) claims to be a blockchain-based social media platform that allows users to control all of their communications with others. This includes preventing screenshots, deleting entire conversations, and controlling settings on the messages sent.

However, upon further inspection, with the help of Culper Research presenting a short report on the company today, I am happy to further support the report and how DATS is far overvalued and does not provide any niche attractions to create growth for users and shareholders. 

When reading the prospectus for the company a few days after the IPO, DATS reports misleading information on blockchain-based social media platform, noting that it is currently in development and the roadmap expects it by Q4 2021. There is no current blockchain based social media platform, misleading shareholders unless they read through the SEC Filing or Investor Presentation. Culper Research notes that there are major security flaws in the Android version of DatChat, claiming to allow hackers access to users information and implementing their own information at times. 

DATS has no sources of revenue. The balance sheet breakdown is pitiful, lacking major R&amp;D expenses as would be expected for a growth company and no source of revenue similar to a biopharmaceutical company. DATS has struggled to monetize their platform and is not specific in how they want to generate revenue. Culper continues further, saying that they have not generated revenue since inception in 2016.

There are a minimal amount of users on the site, with under 100,000 MAUs (Monthly Active Users). For a social media platform, users is the key driver of growth, yet the company cannot attract them, not generating any advertisement expenses and having poor reach to the community. Culper has generously subsidized my research by reporting that the SEC forced DatChat to report their MAUs. The company reported them for the prospectus and has since stopped reporting when filing.

After further inspection, an associate that brought DATS onto our radar mentioned the company after just IPO-ing. They then remained in our chat for less than a month. I have experienced a similar occasion on getting caught in a penny stock pump-and-dump with an associate mentioning and then leaving chat. DATS' days are numbered as there is no material backing for the company and no sources of revenue that could support them.

Multiple 4/A Insider Trading Reports were filed at the end of September and this past week in October. Filers are preparing to most likely sell these shares when the lockup period ends as Culper notes in November. 

Overall, this company is not worth the money and does not have signs of strength or a niche to profit from. I would be warry as investors are irrational and can pump meme stocks, adding DATS to that list and getting burned for shorting. However, in the long run, this company is inefficient and does not provide what they claim. Culper Research has expanded on these points mentioned and I am happy to agree with them after my own research on the company.

AerSale isn't a  fashionable speculative EV or crypto play, it's an aviation company with  real products, revenues and profits. But who wants to touch an aviation  stock during a pandemic? Read on...

My  bullish hypothesis is based on the expectation AerSale will update full  year guidance at their Q3 earnings in the upcoming weeks and announce  FAA certification of their AerAware product (think wearable heads up  display with advanced technology from the F-35 but used in commercial  aviation). I'll explain why I think these two things are going to happen  below but first, a quick overview of the company from their website:

""*A  global aviation leader, AerSale specializes in the sale, lease, and  exchange of used aircraft, engines, and components, in addition to  providing a broad range of maintenance, repair, and overhaul and  engineering services for commercial aircraft and components. AerSale  also offers asset management services to owners of end-of-life aircraft  and engine portfolios.* ""

**Q3 Earnings and full year guidance update**

Q2  earnings full year adjusted EBITDA guidance is $60 - $70 million. Q1  adjusted EBITDA was $16.5 million, Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $30.4 million.  To meet the upper end of their guidance they'd need an adjusted EBITDA  of $23.1 million across Q3 and Q4.

AerSale  have sold 7 aircraft (6x 757 &amp; 1x a320) this quarter vs 3 aircraft  (2x 757, 1x 737) in Q2, that's over double. Even if we assume no  increase in other revenue streams (Q2 earnings call indicates other  revenue streams are doing great and continued momentum is expected), we  would get a figure larger than the Q2 $30.4 million, and that means at a  minimum they’ve met full year guidance within Q3 or better yet, they  beat the full year guidance of $70 million! I expect AerSale to update  full year guidance, being conservative an adjusted EBITDA of $100  million isn't out of reach.

**AerAware FAA certification and launch customer announcement**

AerSale  have been testing their AerAware product in a 737-800 registered as  N737AS. Judging by its flight history, testing is complete and the  aircraft has returned to home base. I'd expect an announcement of  certification on the 737 and a launch customer in the not too distant  future. AerAware will be huge for AerSale as CEO Nicolas Finazzo  explains,

""*Together  with our potential launch customers, suppliers and federal regulators,  we continued to demonstrate and refine AerAware, a wearable heads up  display product, which holds the potential to transform the company  given the* ***multi-billion dollar addressable market*** *for the product*"".

There are other great things about the company but these two are the ones that get me really excited.

Now why it is time to act?

The leader, basically the biggest semi stock considering market cap, TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited) released earnings today. Beats Q3 earnings, sales are up more than 20%, provided better future guidance.

If you know there is a shortage of chips. Will not expand here but you can google it. Market players (CEO and various executives) think it could last up till 2023. We can be sure that in three to six months nothing drastic should change in the market.

Chip shortage doesn't seem to end in the near future. The need for an increase in production capacity should continue to be strong. This is why I believe KLIC is a good possible candidate to buy to swing trade or position trade longer term. 

If you are interested to check KLIC sales and EPs guidance, previous ER, and possible risks that might affect the stock check the video that I made a few days before: [https://youtu.be/yOaa3qgcxmI](https://youtu.be/yOaa3qgcxmI) (go to 2 min to skip the chip shortage situation if you are aware of it).",StockMarket,"This stock is sooo oversold...

**Phosphorus Chemical Industry in China: Sichuan Development Lomon Co Ltd moving unexpectedly**

The phosphorus chemical sector extended its strength, with Sichuan Development Lomon jumping over 9%.

Haitong Securities said that the advantage of phosphorus chemical companies marching into lithium iron phosphate is significant. Enterprises with industrial-grade mono ammonium phosphate and production capacity of purified phosphoric acid, can simultaneously achieve the cost advantage in raw material, and provide raw material security for the large-scale development of iron phosphate. They are expected to occupy a larger share of the iron phosphate market in the future.

**Industry background: Lithium iron phosphate batteries are in short supply**

Lithium iron phosphate batteries have been developed rapidly. According to data from the China Industry Innovation Alliance for Automotive Power Battery, in August, the production of power batteries in China totaled 19.5GWh, ascending 161.7% year-on-year. Among them, the output of lithium iron phosphate batteries was 11.1GWh, accounting for more than half of the total output.

In China, Sichuan Development Lomon is the largest industrial-grade mono ammonium phosphate(MAP) manufacturer. Industrial-grade MAP is important in producing iron phosphate, the precursor of lithium iron phosphate(cathode material for new energy batteries). The company began to sell its industrial-grade MAP to suppliers of iron phosphate last year.

**Industry outlook: closely related to the electric vehicle industry**

In the first half of 2021, Sichuan Development Lomon sold 150,700 tons of industrial-grade MAP, accounting for 28.66% of the total domestic industry sales; at the same time, it is also the largest exporter of industrial-grade MAP in China, occupied 48.1% of the national total.

With the acceleration of the globalization of the electric wave, car companies dedicated to electric vehicles are also snowballing, while the requirements for electric vehicle power batteries are getting higher and higher. As the core component of electric vehicles, the power battery plays a decisive role in the range, safety performance and service life of electric vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to develop power batteries with a higher range, higher safety performance, longer service life and lower production cost.

Lithium iron phosphate batteries(LFP), which do not use cobalt and nickel as raw materials, are able to further reduce costs while maintaining safety. As technology improves, coupled with the need to reduce the price of electric vehicles, it has led to an increase in the number of vehicles using LFP batteries.

**Product application: highly foreign expectations &amp; highly domestic penetration**

Tesla, the top brand in pure electric vehicles, has used Contemporary Amperex Technology's lithium iron phosphate batteries for its electric models, Model 3 and Model Y. On August 21, breaking news from Twitter said that from October 1, 2021, the Model 3/Y standard battery life version, manufactured at its Fremont, Calif., plant, will use lithium iron phosphate batteries from China.

In addition to Tesla, tech giant Apple, which plans to launch an electric car in 2024, has also claimed it will use lithium iron phosphate batteries, saying it is for safety reasons.

Domestic companies are more receptive to lithium iron phosphate batteries. According to statistics, the penetration rate of domestic lithium iron phosphate batteries has reached 30% in the field of new energy passenger cars. All of BYD's models will be equipped with ""blade batteries"" (lithium iron phosphate batteries), XPeng, Nio and other car companies have also been or will be used in lithium iron phosphate batteries.

**Prospectively summarizing**

Sichuan Development Lomon is in upstream of the supply chain of the new energy vehicle industry. With the booming market of electric vehicles and new energy batteries, the demand for industrial-grade MAP as one of the raw materials is growing fast.

According to the company's strategy, in the future, Sichuan Development Lomon Co Ltd will continue to adhere to the ""scarce resources + technological innovation"" strategy, actively layout new energy, new materials and other fields, accelerate industrial upgrading, improve the industrial chain, and strive to become the industry's leading enterprise with core competitiveness in the field of advantageous mineral resources and deep processing.

Accordingly, the choice of the stock LSE:MMK or MOEX:MAGN was made in the logic of the approach to value investing and so let's go

Why MMK?

# Key factors and catalysts

1. Annual forward dividend approximate to 40% in H2 2021
2. Should significantly increase production up to 30%
3. Cost less than competitors in one sector on P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples
4. Beneficiary of commodity supercycle 2021
5. Most likely going to be included in the MSCI Russia index
6. The desire of the main shareholder to increase free-float by 2%, which gives an increase in FIF by 0.5 and weight in the MSCI index
7. Main beneficiary from the transition from duties to MET tax from the beginning of 2022
8. Main beneficiary from the decline in world prices for iron ore and high prices for hot-rolled steel
9. Negative debt load
10. Making every effort to be ESG friendly
11. An unprecedented openness and disclosure of information to investors
12. It is a super clear and transparent business with a double-digit dividend history

You can get to know MMK in more detail and comprehensively through the [Integrated Annual Report 2020](http://eng.mmk.ru/upload/iblock/fd8/Integrated%20Annual%20Report_ENG.pdf)

# Financial Analysis and forecast of indicators on Q3`21

# For analysis MMK kindly provides a [date sheet](http://eng.mmk.ru/upload/iblock/4e0/MMK_operating_d_financial_data_Q2_2021.xls) with quarterly financial and operational indicators for the last few years.

Since I am a programmer by my main profession, the data obtained will make friends in TimeSeries the database and draw graphs in Grafana (*with the permission of the moderators, I can give a link to the github project with all the necessary*)

**See the main indicators for revenue and EBITDA**

https://preview.redd.it/qjm2nlo28fn71.png?width=2506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9566329492160cddd9bd0a9f5462310d78887c3

In the second quarter of 2021, the commodity supercycle had already begun, but at that time no one knew for certain whether it was he or a fleeting phenomenon.

**Сonsistently pay dividends of 100% or more of free cash flow**

https://preview.redd.it/mrkcnef38fn71.png?width=2494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f17f94390eb19c135276e0e6a5efb1875a5dd9e

In the second COVID-19 quarter of 2020, there was a recession and the dividend payment was postponed to the 3rd quarter. You can notice the lag of growth of the FCF from EBITDA in Q2 2022

**Dynamics Production indicators**

https://preview.redd.it/orrgy3g68fn71.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb542835c7165feb03f27f5687bb310ad354dde7

The production has a consistently high capacity utilization close to 95%, with the exception of the Q2 of 2020 COVID-19 of the year

**Consolidated sales by product type and forecast on Q3\`21**

https://preview.redd.it/976sf1q78fn71.png?width=2496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1624b4562931263529d236078a93a3e739f9c3e

From the latest financial report, management is optimistic about sales in Q4

&gt;Seasonal recovery in demand in Russia and continued favorable conditions on the global markets will have a positive impact on the Group's sales volumes in Q3. Additional support for sales volumes will be provided by the start of hot tests of an electric steel-making shop with a casting and rolling module at a Turkish asset.

This is confirmed by independent statistics on steel loading according to the statistics of the railway.(*Loading by rail avg line*)

**EBITDA/t and steel product sales price USD/t and forecast on Q3\`21**

https://preview.redd.it/wivqluj88fn71.png?width=2498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb7b8bb121841502dbfbf3b05a287319c074309

We came to the most interesting thing about the reason for the growth of key financial indicators. This is a significant increase in the spread between the cost per ton of products in the form of the cost of cash-cost slab and the weighted average co-consolidated selling price of all finished products.(*EBITDA per tonne*)

Where the weighted average price is derived from the correlation to China's FOB export prices with a lag of one month

**Price correlation to STEEL HRC FOB CHINA Futures - (MHCc1) with a lag of one month**

https://preview.redd.it/p1rd9c0b8fn71.png?width=2310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e66727849c9ce4a434b6e40efbf9b44fd0a18a

And in a similar way, we get the correlation of the iron ore/Coal containing part of the cash-cost slab to the stock prices of Iron Ore 62%/Coal Futures with a lag of one month

https://preview.redd.it/hjkngvfc8fn71.png?width=2516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=057f0a9c689cd720c7cea4396788024bbf23ab41

The key point is a lag in prices for one month, which is due to the specifics in the formula for concluding supply contracts. What does this mean in practice? The fact that the 3rd quarter ends at the end of September, and at the beginning of September, the products have already been contracted at the price we know. And as we could see above, the price is a key factor in the growth of financial indicators.

Accordingly, already now we know quite reliably what the financial indicators will be and, in accordance with the dividend policy, will be able to calculate the dividend for the 3rd quarter.

We calculate financial indicators for the 3rd quarter of 2021

* **Revenue - $ 3302.6 million** to increase by 1.5% q / q (3370 \* 980)
* **EBITDA - $ 1,380.7 million** decrease by 3.8% q/q including the effect of duties $ 60 million (3,370 \* 427.5-60000)
* **Profit - $ 1017 million** (1380.7-125) \* (1-0.19)
* **Total NWC - a decrease by $ 259 million** due to a significant decrease in world prices for iron ore and a decrease in prices for finished products due to the introduction of temporary duties on inventories (1425 \* (0.4 \* 0.33 + 0.20 \* 0.25))
* **FCF - $ 1,045 million**, an increase of 92% q/q (EBITDA-Change in PSC-CAPEX-Taxes = 1380.7 + 259-350-245)
* **Dividend - $0.11. an increase of 222%** taking into account compensation over a cappex ((1045 + 350-175) / 11174.33) or 9.4% in quarter

There is also a backlog of growth in financial indicators in the 4th quarter, which should have a positive effect on the growth catalyst

Including in the MSCIA Russia index

Let's take the current [composition of the MSCI Russia index](https://app2.msci.com/eqb/custom_indexes/russia_performance.html) and calculate the capitalization for the current FIF 0.20 excluding an increase to 0.25 in the event of the planned next SPO by 2%.

We will get an MCap FIF of 2,2 billion USD for MMK at a share price of 78.7 rubles (which seems quite achievable with 10% forward dividends), which will overtake MAIL.RU, INTER RAO and VTB BANK with a weight of 0.8%

His fund has consistently beaten the market over the last 30 years. The fund has had an average return of 66% before fees during the period of 1988-2018!

To put these returns in perspective, $100 invested into the Medallion Fund in 1988 would have converted into $398 Million by 2018. Even net of fees \[1\], the fund has outperformed S&amp;P 500 returns by \~1000 times and Warren Buffet’s returns by \~200 times!

If you are still not convinced about the absurdity of the returns, take a look at the following chart which showcases the annual returns for the Medallion fund in comparison with S&amp;P 500.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zqobnspnjgn71.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d652822bd056bb70ab7ccafe6117d61f0b18f4f1)

Notice anything strange? Since its creation, the fund has only lost money in a single year \[2\] (1989). For the next 30 continuous years, there was not even a single year where their returns dropped below 20%. Even at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, the fund had made an 82% gain net of fees!

We all know that Hedge Funds gets a lot of hate, most of the time justifiably so. But returns like this sustained for such a long time period call for further scrutiny. So in this week’s analysis, we are deep-diving into how the Medallion Fund created such outsized returns for its investors.

**The Beginnings**

Jim Simons has a Ph.D. in Mathematics, taught math at MIT, and has worked for NSA as their codebreaker before turning his attention to the stock market. He was one of the first people who realized that pattern recognition could be applied to beat the stock market.

He created a trading system that uses quantitative models and formed Renaissance Technologies in 1982. The peculiar thing about this hedge fund is that it does not hire anyone from financial or business backgrounds.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/foxvgbfpjgn71.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614887a1751558912caea2a2f6774b73c2bc9d5a)

They solely focus on physicists, statisticians, mathematicians, and signal processing experts and believe that the herd-like mentality of business school graduates leads to poor returns! Renaissance’s headquarters is famously known as the world’s best physics and mathematics department.

This view is extended to their investment philosophy as highlighted by Robert Mercer (Co-CEO), Medallion Fund only focuses on the quantitative model recommendations and not the underlying business performance/strategy \[3\].

**Fund Performance**

I know we discussed the extraordinary returns of the fund in the beginning, but the following chart will put the sheer numbers into perspective.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hez5elmqjgn71.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7bf4ac2b837147c548f13847c07b27d7a1264c)

By now we know that the fund has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a wide margin. But in [this research paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504766) by Bradford Cornell (Finance Prof at UCLA), he argued that even if the investor had the ability to predict the stock market returns perfectly on a monthly basis (shift the money to treasury during downturns and back to stocks during the upswings), the investor would only have been able to turn the $100 into $331K (an insane 331,100% return) but even this would be nothing in comparison to the \~$400 MM return generated by The Medallion Fund.

  

It’s not often you see Warren Buffet so low down a list for long-term investment returns. The Medallion Fund has beaten all the well-known investment managers by a wide margin over its 30 year period.

**Fund Strategy**

While the exact inner workings of the fund are only known to a few key insiders who are tightly bound by confidentiality clauses, what we know comes mainly from the book ‘The Man Who Solved The Market’ by Gregory Zuckerman \[4\].

As per the book, Medallion strategy involves holding thousands of short-term long, and short positions (aka like your avg [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user) at any given time. Allegedly, they win 50.75% of the trades they make (not like your avg [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user) which is enough to make them billions as they are conducting millions of trades every year.

Adding to the excellent quantitative models they have created, Medallion Fund also did two things right

1. **Leverage:** It’s estimated that Medallion trades with 12.5x leverage on average with it going up to 20x when the system is confident. If you remove the leverage from the picture, the fund’s returns are similar to S&amp;P 500. It’s their effective usage of leverage and deep understanding of risks involved that makes their returns legendary
2. **Fund size cap:** The fund has made sure that their Asset Under Management (AUM) never goes beyond $10Billion. They understand that adding more money might not work with the same strategies and have paid out their returns to their investors to keep the AUM same.

**What does this mean for an average investor?**

The Medallion Fund has been closed to outside investors since 1993. As of now, only the existing and previous employees of the company can invest in the fund. The funds of Renaissance that are open to the public have performed so poorly that the two funds made it the HSBC’s top 20 losers list for 2020.

While it certainly is a bummer that the average investor cannot invest in the fund, this analysis gave us some key insights into the market. The first and most important being that the stock market is not perfectly efficient and that there are inefficiencies that someone can leverage for more than 3 decades. The second being that not all funds that charge an exorbitant fee structure \[1\] are taking money away from the investor. In Medallion’s case, they are justifying their eye-watering fee structure with phenomenal returns.

Finally, this should not be considered as a call to action to find similar funds as not every team with stellar people end up producing market-beating returns \[5\]

**Conclusion**

It’s like Jim Simon’s had created a license to print money with the Medallion Fund. How long the fund’s algorithms can remain a secret and continue generating market-beating returns is anyone’s guess. My incredulity and skepticism during this analysis was perfectly captured by Bradford Cornell in his research paper

&gt;During the entire 31-year period, Medallion never had a negative return despite the dot.com crash and the financial crisis. Despite this remarkable performance, the fund’s market beta and factor loadings were all negative, so that Medallion’s performance cannot be interpreted as a premium for risk bearing.

To date, there is no adequate rational market explanation for this performance.

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The fund charges an exorbitant amount of fees. From 2002 onwards, it has a 5% management fee and 44% performance fee. To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into the fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $130K (a 30% return), they would charge you $5K (5% management fee) + $13.2K (44% of the profit) for a total of $18.2K in fees. So your net returns would only be 11.8%. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $5K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!

\[2\] Even in the year, their returns were negative, the fund returns before the fee were + 1%. The 5% management fee pushed them to the -4% net returns.

The Good: Earnings per share in the quarter reached $1.03, better than the projection of $0.97. Guidance for the upcoming fiscal year was also strong.

The Bad: Oracle reported revenue of $9.73 billion, short of the projection of $9.75 billion. And while the company’s cloud business grew, it did not keep up with competitors.

Numbers: Oracle’s share price is near an all-time high. It is up 39% in 2021, but down 2% during the last month.

Final Thoughts: It is clear that Oracle is not the most loved legacy tech company. While revenue is up year-over-year, its competitors are growing faster. Oracle needs to catch up.

Introduction

Mining exploration is undergoing a revolution; only the mining industry hasn’t realized it yet. The insurgents leading the revolution come from Goldspot Discoveries, a small Canadian technology company that is bringing AI/Machine Learning into the traditional geosciences field that has long dominated the exploration game. Still an early-stage company, Goldspot remains undervalued even as it has consistently outperformed expectations while delivering outstanding revenue growth and profitability. The company is well capitalized and has built a huge head start on any future competition that will take several years (at best) to close. While all of these factors would be a great story for any company, they aren’t even the best part of the Goldspot story. Just like the group of MIT students used data analysis methodologies to stick it to the blackjack casinos (described in the book Bringing Down the House and the film 21), Goldspot is cracking the code for junior mining investment in order to rewrite the odds of the game in their favor. To put it simply, this is the moment where big data meets small miners – and one of the first hands Goldspot has played (New Found Gold - $NFG) has already given the house a good shake.

Company Overview

Goldspot Discoveries started as a group of data scientists out of Quebec that competed in a mining technology challenge. Their approach to improving mining exploration was to utilize advanced data analysis techniques to improve the probability of drilling success. This group of scientist were connected with Denis Laviolette and Cejay Kim and together they turned this new technical approach into a functioning geoscience consulting business. Goldspot was officially formed in 2016, and then went public via a reverse merger in early 2019. For the last several fiscal quarters, Goldspot has seen revenues skyrocket (see charts in later sections), while building an investment portfolio that would make many far larger companies green with envy. Goldspot has been rewarded for its strong operational and financial performance with 8-fold gains in its stock price in the last 12 months (achieved on consistent and sustainable price gains). Looking forward, Goldspot has put teasers into the market of several new technologies, products in the r/D pipeline, and strategic partnerships that should deliver strong shareholder value into the future.

Goldspot is a technology and consultancy company that specializes in applying machine learning &amp; artificial intelligence to collect, interpret and convert data into so-called 'Smart Targets' that can pinpoint the exact location of potential new resource reserves.

Contrary to what the company’s name would suggest, Goldspot specializes in finding almost any commodity reserve. Many of Goldspot's current clients are gold miners and silver miners, but there is also significant demand from the lithium, copper and base metal industry for Goldspot's services.

The search for new mineral reserves is not a new phenomenon. But with a dwindling number of new discoveries, the global supply chain is facing a decreasing supply and a rising demand. With fewer, smaller and more expensive discoveries, the mining sector is facing a problematic issue. Goldspot is tactically responding to this with the introduction of deep learning algorithms that can highlight and identify new innovative mathematical solutions and interpretations on geological patterns. Deep learning makes it possible to analyze an enormous amount of data that is virtually impossible for the human brain to analyze and interpret properly.

The new technologies have enabled Goldspot to produce results that were not possible before. This significantly increases the reliability &amp; accuracy of the targets. In addition to the extreme accuracy of Goldspot's results, Goldspot saves its clients a lot of time and money by letting software do the bulk of the work. By reducing costly human labor and time while improving results Goldspot has set up a compelling alternative to traditional methods and has proven to be a very attractive solution for mining companies.

Goldspot's Business Model

Summary

One of best way to analyze Goldspot’s business is to look at it as a car. The AI/Machine Learning (discussed in detail below) is the engine and the rest of the business model is the vehicle that is built around that engine. At its core, Goldspot is a technology company. Upwards of 2/3rds of the its employees work on the technical side of the business – mostly out of its location in Montreal. Quebec is a highly underrated hotspot of engineering and technical talent, with several top universities nearby turning out top-notch talent.

Goldspot has brought onboard well over 20 PhD’s in diverse but related fields such as structural geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and complex data science and so forth. The beauty of Goldspot is its ability to integrate the results of these various fields into a simplified target analysis. Once its geoscience tools are built, Goldspot can then apply it on a wide-scale to create a competitive advantage for its clients.

Goldspot's business model currently consists of 4 segments:

Consultancy Services (Smart target generation)
Investments
Software as a Service (SaaS)
Exploration (Golden Planet Mining)
Consultancy Services

Goldspot is advising mining entities for target generation to find new potential reserves with the aforementioned 'Smart Targets' that have been derived from the in-house AI &amp; machine learning algorithms. Goldspot concludes contracts with its clients that cover the costs incurred and generate an decent operating profit for Goldspot that are in line with the average margins in the consultancy sector.

Figure 1: Growth of Goldspot's Consultancy revenue

The Consultancy turnover is growing by approximately 100% on an annual basis since Goldspot’s inception and consists of time waged contracts with mining corporations. The mining corporations can be subdivided into two categories: Junior miners (small mining companies that do not yet have an operational mine, but do have a piece of land, a so called claim) and Majors (mining companies that already have at least one operational mine).

Goldspot’s Consultancy services are based on the in-house processing of historical and/or public big data sets of the client’s claim. In combination with the use of Goldspot’s AI and machine learning algorithms the company is able to extract correlations &amp; recognize patterns in the big data sets that provide sustained conclusions about a client’s claim.

Goldspot recently acquired the full-service field exploration firm ‘Ridgeline Exploration’ to provide a full-service solution to solve common inconsistent and piecemeal data collection practices that increase risk and lower efficiency across the industry. With the acquisition of Ridgeline, GoldSpot aims to strengthen its existing consultancy business as well as vertically integrate the ability to capture key data, including airborne geophysical survey mapping, geochemistry, structural mapping and geophysics. By improving the reliability of the big data sets Goldspot works with, the accuracy of the generated Smart Targets will considerably improve.

Figure 2 Vertical Integration using Ridgeline Exploration Services

Goldspot has provided consultancy services for big names in the sector like Yamana Gold, Fortuna Silver Mines, Sprott Mining and Vale to name a few, as well as countless Junior Miners among which are the names of New Found Gold, Critical Elements Lithium Corporation and Nevada King Gold Corp.

https://preview.redd.it/5ei7x8bj6hn71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=597dcad44114d82a2f3b1c91f7c13c509cef7466

Investments

But that is only the first part of the equation. By being able to evaluate large swaths of data over a vast geographical region Goldspot has an edge in being able to pick the potential winners and losers among junior mining exploration companies before everyone else. This is like having the cheat codes to the mining investment game.

Now it is often so that Junior miners do not have enough working capital to engage Goldspot on their project. They are short on cash and cannot meet the requested rates from Goldspot. Goldspot has devised a smart solution for this particular problem. Before entering into a negotiation with the Junior miner, Goldspot analyzes the claim (territory) of the Junior miner using its in-house software &amp; deep learning algorithms and determines whether there is a significant probability that there is a promising reserve to be found on the claim based on their initial analysis. If that probability looks promising, Goldspot offers to take equity (shares and/or warrants) in the Junior Miner. They participate in a 'Private Placement' which allows the Junior Miner to raise money by issuing shares and/or warrants. As a result the Junior Miner can pay for Goldspot's consultancy services with the capital they raised. Every now and then Goldspot also negotiates for an NSR as part of a deal. An NSR, an abbreviation for ‘Net Smelter Return’, is a royalty on the net gold quantity a mine produces. These NSR’s are often set around 0.5%-2%.

By applying this method, Goldspot has in addition to a consultancy contract, acquired an interest in the Junior miner. This creates a significant synergy when Goldspot delivers successful 'Smart Targets' and when these targets are also successfully tapped into. As a result the shares of the Junior Miner will increase significantly in value with Goldspot having a stake in the company.

E.g. One of Goldspot's first clients was the junior miner New Found Gold. Goldspot had at the time entered into a contract with New Found Gold and acquired 1.7M shares and an NSR of 0.5% on the claim using the aforementioned method. At that time, the price of one NFG share was $0.40. After delivering the ""Smart Targets"" and successful drilling, which continues to this day, the stock has now increased in value by 30 times at a price of $12 per share. As a result, Goldspot's initial investment of $680,000 has appreciated to $20.4M, delivering an unrealized profit of $19.72M. The exact worth of the 0.5% NSR Goldspot acquired on NFG’s claim is difficult to estimate until an exact resource estimation and a PFS (Pre-Feasibility Study) and PEA (Pre-Economic Study). Very likely though NFG's 0.5% NSR is worth something in the ""tens"" of millions but that is still very speculative. Now, certainly not every Junior Miner will be a success story like New Found Gold. However Goldspot’s approach on investing in Junior Miners significantly de-risks their Junior Miner portfolio in comparison to other Junior Miner ETF’s. Further elaboration on this in the next paragraph.

Figure 3: New Found Gold equity position when Goldspot entered the agreement in 2019 and in 2021 after Goldspot successfully delivered numerous drill targets that where successfully tapped into.

Goldspot is very selective on what Junior Miners the company decides to engage with. To create the highest chance of success they’ve established a data based approach on finding the best deals on the market. They have previously referred to this as ‘Resource Quantamental’ and they described it as an AI-driven opportunity generator pointing Goldspot to the ideal companies to work with. Resource Quantamental is the largest aggregate of mining data in the world and makes use of all the big data sets available on the capital markets, management compatibility and historical drilling results as well as geologic data. The output serves Goldspot with the ideal companies that have the highest chance of success when Goldspot engages with them.

Software as a Service

To grow Goldspot’s consultancy revenue the current team is becoming increasingly more efficient as they develop better skills &amp; internal work processes mature. Furthermore, the company is actively hiring more staff. However, this will pose a problem in the long run. Consultancy business is very employee intensive, and unlike other sectors, there is a great scarcity of people with degrees with the combination of Geology &amp; Data Science. For Goldspot however, people with these profiles are a necessity.

To overcome this problem and make the in-house technology scalable and lucrative, Goldspot has decided to develop &amp; acquire mining related SaaS products. Work is currently underway for the launch of two highly technical SaaS products that are expected to launch in Q4 2021.

One of those two new SaaS products is LithoLens, Goldspot’s core imaging technology which adds value by extracting geological information from otherwise unused core photography, providing brand new data for 3D modelling and exploration purposes. Core logging is an essential step in the exploration process. It is the manual systematic recording and measuring of information from drill core to determine the lithology, mineralogy, geological history, structure and alteration zones. Due to being a highly manual repetitive task, core logging is subject to human error and rising costs. Litholens can work with imagery from historic and recent drill core photographs, to downhole optical and acoustic televiewer files, to videos of seafloor nodule deposits used in deep-sea mining. The data inserted in Litholens is processed in the cloud and the machine learning creates large and valuable new datasets from underutilized imagery and video data. The total addresable market for Litholens – the so called ‘core logging market’ currently has a turnover of around $50M per year, but Litholens ability to relog historical imagery could open up a opportunity closer to $500M.

LithoLens is a software solution that once available to the mining sector, has the potential to provide Goldspot with an additional revenue stream that, unlike the majority of consulting services, is reoccurring in nature. As a result of this potential for significant recurring revenue, the LithoLens technology is a focal point of Goldspot’s future growth.

​

Core logging

​

Core logging analytics

Goldspot recently enhanced its Litholens development by acquiring the tech company Geotic. Geotic’s portfolio of 5 software tools (GeoticMine, GeoticLog, GeoticGraph, GeoticCAD and GeoticField) offer diversified 3D modelling and core-logging, improving the way that Geologists and Engineers collect and analyze data. The powerful combination of GeoticLog and LithoLens will create an industry-first core logging and AI imaging cloud solution.

The second SaaS product scheduled for launch in Q4 2021 is called ‘MinusOne’ and is a software solution for creating 3-D models from geophysical data processed using deterministic and stochastic inversion methods. With this technology, Goldspot's team also applies a ML (machine learning) method to provide probabilistic framework that helps to analyze uncertainty. The processed results guide exploration drilling locations and geology interpretation.

Goldspot has now over 40 research and development products currently in development and is now at the point where many of these tools can be monetized on a much larger scale as external software solutions.

CEO.CA acquisition – the next birthplace for Junior Miners &amp; mining companies

On the 16th August 2021 Goldspot announced their intent to acquire the social investor network CEO.CA. CEO.CA is an international investor website with the focus on Canadian listed companies. Canada is the global hub for mining entities to seek financing and there are thousands of global mining companies listed on the TSX-V exchange (Toronto Stock Exchange).

""GoldSpot's focus is to unlock value in mineral exploration with data science and machine learning and we are proud to serve more than fifty global exploration companies in this endeavour. The acquisition of CEO.CA, and the establishment of a technology and media division, is strategic to that vision and provides significant economic potential to our clients and shareholders,"" commented GoldSpot Executive Chairman &amp; President Denis Laviolette.

Golden Planet Mining

Aside from taking equity in third parties, Goldspot has decided to leverage their own tech &amp; brand awareness to set up their own exploration company: Golden Planet Mining (GPM). Formerly known as XCorp AI they merged with Saskatchewan Gold Corp. to acquire the ‘Mammoth Gold Project’ situated in Saskatchewan, Canada, and form the combined entity Golden Planet Mining. Originally Goldspot invested $475K cad in XCorp AI. Their equity in the combined entity GPM appreciated to $7.78M cad following the next raise, and has since ballooned to $15,53M in the most recent raise to date. At the moment Goldspot holds 28% of Golden Planet Mining with the company looking to go public in late 2021 or early 2022. Following the merger with Saskatchewan Gold Corp, Golden planet Mining has acquired ownership of the Olympus Gold Project in the Northwest Territories and the Rider Gold Project in British Columbia and commenced drilling activities &amp; regional exploration on the properties. Using Goldspot’s in-house exploration and data processing tech the claims are being further explored and drilled for more data. If good results appear GPM has a good probability of becoming a major success story for Goldspot.

How AI and Machine Learning Creates a Competitive Advantage

Good companies sell a quality product, great companies solve a problem, but the very best companies solve a problem before you even know you have one. The metal/non-metal mining industry has a problem it is either unaware of, or refuses to admit. The problem: the exploration industry is unable to find new big deposits that can be economically extracted without undue environmental damage in order to replace depleted reserves of current major mining companies.

Exploration by junior mining is one of the great perpetual boom and bust industries. Every year, fortunes are made and lost betting on junior mining companies on the TSX Venture Exchange. Junior miners are typically smaller companies (most with a market cap well under $50 million) that secure land and mining claims in hopes of finding the next big mineral find. When a company makes a big find, the rewards are incredibly lucrative, that can in the tens of thousands of percent gains big. For years, the market unduly rewarded junior miners who found massive mineral deposits. Seemingly, the only metric that mattered was coming up with a big P&amp;P reserve in the tens of millions of ounces.

But the sad reality is that an overwhelming majority of junior mining companies fail well before mining operations can even begin on these massive mineral finds. At any given time, there are 3,000+ active junior miners trading on the TSX-V exchange. Although most junior miners experience major shifts up and down in share price, it is very rare to get a big win long-term gainer among the junior mining companies. When long-term wins do happen, it is like lightning in a bottle – with sufficient gains to make up for a large number of losses. The key to being a long-term winner is cost of extraction, not volume. For example, an operation with 2 million ounces of gold that be extracted at an AISC cost of $350 is far more attractive of an acquisition target for a major mining company than an operation with 30 million ounces of gold that can be extracted for $1,100 an ounce.

So why are so many junior mining companies fail? It isn’t necessarily that the companies have bad properties or don’t find valuable minerals (although that is possible). The reality is that junior mining companies typically fail because they simply run out of money. In order to develop a mining project all the way to production (or acquisition by a major), the junior mining company needs to find the right deposit, with the right economics, with the right timing and all within its limited financial resources. If the company has money to institute a drilling program, the junior mining company usually only has one chance to get it right and obtain a good drill result. If it does, stock price goes up and the junior miner is able to an equity raise sufficient to move on to the next stage of the process. Any faltering along the way, and the entire project (and usually the company itself) goes up in flames. Truly, it creates a “discover or die” environment. Additionally, that discover needs to be in a location and grade that suggests that it can be removed economically.

While this environment of “discover or die” has always existed for junior miners, there are two more recent industry trends/conditions that are making it even tougher for juniors to succeed. First, mineral finds are become harder and harder to locate. The minerals being found are greater depths or in environments with less surface indicators. This means that there are less easy finds available waiting to be discovered. The second trend is for junior miners to pursue “district-scale” projects. Investors in junior miners are generally looking for companies with huge land holdings so that if there is a find, the potential payouts can be exponentially greater. At the same time, most mining laws around the world require a claim holder to invest a certain amount of money on an annual basis in developing a claim as well as pay a claim fee. These costs are not trivial and can total several million dollars on an annual basis for junior miners with large land packages. So with these additional factors, junior miners are having to look for a smaller needle in a bigger haystack that costs more money to maintain.

In this environment smaller needles in bigger haystacks, Goldspot is solving the budding problem by building a better mouse trap. With diminishing surface indicators, mining exploration companies need to effectively integrate data obtained from multiple sources. Each time you stack a different level of data on top of another set of data, the complexity does not increase linearly, rather it increases exponentially. The beauty of AI and machine learning tools is that they are able look at data from a potentially limitless pool of data and find subtle geological, geophysical or other structural indicators that collectively increase the likelihood for success. The Goldspot AI tool finds regions or structures where probability of mineralization are higher, but once a general region has been identified, the same tools are also able to narrow in on specific targets to confirm mineralization on a claim that provide a substantially higher likelihood of finding mineralization.

Risks to the business

Each business carries risks along with their operations. The main risks to Goldspot’s business model are listed below:

Cash Flows From Consulting Income

Goldspot currently generates revenue and cash flows from its consulting services. The availability of these sources of funds and Goldspot's ability to maintain a network and attract additional customers will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside of Goldspot's control. A significant portion of Goldspot's revenues have come from four customers in short-term contracts. Goldspot's contracts are generally short-term and it is actively seeking to diversify its customer base with longer-term contracts. The loss of any one of its customers or the inability to attract additional customers will result in a material adverse effect on the business and may adversely affect revenues going forward.

Intellectual Property Risk

The ownership and protection of Goldspot's intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of Goldspot's future success. Currently, Goldspot relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information to protect its intellectual property. Goldspot also attempts to protects its intellectual property by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as business partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. Any of these parties may breach these agreements and Goldspot may not have adequate remedies for any specific breach. In addition, Goldspot's trade secrets and technical know-how, which are not protected by patents, may otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors, in which event Goldspot's business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially affected. An assertion by a third-party that Goldspot is infringing its intellectual property could subject Goldspot to costly and time-consuming litigation, which could harm its business. Goldspot's success depends in part upon it not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. However, Goldspot's competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to Goldspot's industry or, in some cases, its technology. Goldspot has not been subjected to any claims of intellectual property rights infringements in the past but as it develops more of its own applications and meets additional client specific requests, it may be exposed to greater risk in the future. Any claims or litigation could cause Goldspot to incur significant expenses, and if successfully asserted against Goldspot, could require that Goldspot pay substantial damages or ongoing revenue share payments, indemnify its customers or distributors, obtain licenses, modify products, or refund fees, any of which would deplete Goldspot's resources and adversely impact its business.

Investment Risks

Through its investing division, Goldspot may acquire securities of public and private companies from time to time, which are primarily junior or small-cap companies. Poor investment performance could impair revenues and growth. The market values of the securities can experience significant fluctuations in the short and long term due to factors beyond Goldspot's control. Market value can be reflective of the actual or anticipated operating results of the companies and/or the general market conditions in a specific sector as a whole, such as fluctuations in commodity prices and global political and economic conditions. Goldspot's investments will be carried at fair value, and unrealized gains/losses on the securities and realized losses on the securities sold could have a material adverse impact on Goldspot's operating results. There is no assurance that Goldspot will be able to achieve or maintain any particular level of investment return, which may have a material adverse impact on its ability to attract investors. Furthermore, the junior mining space tends to be more volatile than the general market indices. This volatility combined with negative or poor performance could combine to lead to a reduction in investor interest.

Cyclical Downturn

A significant operating risk affecting Goldspot is a downturn in demand for its services due a decrease in activity in the mining industry. A severe and persistent downturn in the mining industry would have severe consequences on the business of Goldspot. In many cases, capital markets are the only source of funds available to junior mining companies and any change in the outlook for the sector or the lack of success of a specific exploration program can quickly impair the ability of these juniors to raise capital to pay for their consulting services.

Limited Operating History

Goldspot began carrying on business in 2017 and started to generate significant revenue from its operations beginning in December 31, 2018. Goldspot is therefore subject to many of the risks common to early stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and limited revenues. There is no assurance that Goldspot will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders' investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations.

In addition, Nuclear Power is expected to grow in importance and efficiency with a possible transition from Fission to Fusion power. Fusion power has the capability to provide a multiple amount of power more than Fission and increased efficiency. Many people, such as the WallStreetBets community has taken notice. [Uranium Stocks Jump as Reddit’s WallStreetBets Goes Nuclear - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uranium-stocks-jump-as-reddits-wallstreetbets-goes-nuclear-11631538583) 

Here's why Nuclear can help close the gap to zero carbon emissions. 

MIT recently did a study highlighting the importance of diversity in electricity production:  [Deep Decarbonization of the U.S. Electricity Sector: Is There a Role for Nuclear Power? | MIT Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/publication/17323) . Nuclear deserves a seat at the table. Today Nuclear Power generates 50% of non carbon electricity in the US. As the conversation about our green energy future continues lets not forget about nuclear and how we can make it safer by upgrading existing plants with safety improvements. Nuclear runs 95% of the time vs it's counterparts which need wind or sun to operate. In addition, a lot of trees have to be cut down for wind and solar. It's clear a mix of energy production options are key.

The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, it’s likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.
The CPI report comes at a time when the market’s attention is firmly focused on when the Fed will announce it will start scaling back pandemic-era quantitative easing. Powell has offered no signal beyond saying it “could be this year.” Other members of the Fed have been more hawkish in their stance. As I have reiterated more times than I can count, I remain unconcerned with tapering talks (see the 2013 Taper Tantrum). I remain bullish until the Fed begins considering interest rate hikes, at which time I will reassess.
In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news.

 It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.” As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA).

- A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday.

# TMC - High Gamma, High Short Interest, but high IV (from 9-13-21)

As noted in my previous post, I've been keeping track of a few deSPACs.

Note: I'm going to rush typing this, as TMC seems to be going through a squeeze today so I want to get this out as quickly as possible. Apologies for the shittiness of it. I started this last night after getting back from vacation but have had other things to take care of. (Edit while proofreading: FUCK it keeps going up!)

VIH update

My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pl54tq/vih_another_possible_nuclear_gamma_ramp/) was mostly about VIH, and I included a [shitty spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16jMO1b9StmqqmJb6rL2ZsJKS-FE_WBB7QXXUn2AWDgg/edit?usp=sharing) that I've been half-heartedly keeping up to date. I was unaware that the [SOAC -&gt; TMC redemption](https://twitter.com/specialsitsnews/status/1436078905014857730?s=21) had occurred and the redemption number was quite large: 91%.

**I still think VIH is a decent bet on a** ***future*** **deSPAC hype/squeeze/squeeze attempt, but until that redemption occurs (which I have no idea when that would be), I don't expect much to happen.** I have a small position in October ATM calls ($10, $11, $12.50) as those could see some IV boost.

Set-up of TMC (formerly SOAC)

As noted above, the redemption took place Thursday.

It looks like TMC has a pretty great set-up, with one catch: **The IV is already through the roof.**

Here's a summary:

* Redemption was 92%, leaving 2.7m shares floated. Against the existing OI and SI, this is rather small.
* DeltaFlux table is incredibly bullish, I'd expect it to at least hit the gamma peak of \~$10.75 sometime soon (edit: already happened).
* It's like IRNT was, except has a *very significant* amount of shares shorted (relative to float).
* I think downside is \~$10.00 (maybe $9.00), whereas $15 or $20 is obtainable. I like those odds.
* IV is already jacked, so I'm going in with shares. You can try your luck at OTMs if you have the balls for it.

DeltaFlux Table

Here's a summary:

* 1.00% float per 1.00% price movement is very sizeable -- **TMC is at \~3.50%.** Note that this is using a high IV to calculate gamma, MMs are likely using a bit lower, so I believe actual gamma is a bit higher. Of course this is all an approximation anyway -- high gamma is high gamma.
* Net delta is &gt;100% float. That's pretty awesome.
* **For comparison,** [**see the post on IRNT before it blew up**](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/phc0uk/irnt_glitched_float_whale_oi_nuclear_gamma_ramp/)**. Gamma was at 2.50%, and shares deltahedged was at 91.00%.**

The last value I got from Ortex for SOAC, the ticker before redemption, was \~1.8m (***9-14 EOD update is \~1.2m***). Compared to a 2.7m float, where a shit ton of that is tied up in deltahedging options, that's a very high percentage.

Also, given IRNT and the psuedo-retail-squeeze-season we're in, the situation for shorts is highly volatile and they might be easily squeezed.

**I can see a squeeze happening here quite easily.** Especially if it gets started before Sep 16/17, when MMs might dehedge a bit. If the squeeze pushes prices up above, say, $12.00, we'll have positive charm meaning MMs might not dehedge very hard at all.

 

[Here's the Ortex screenshot for SOAC \(from 9-13-21\).](https://preview.redd.it/wkmq5vfanjn71.png?width=1729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038719dedfacd9663b6b9c7e99d2f636ca00acc0)

&amp;#x200B;

[ Ortex info for TMC. They don't have estimated SI, since the ticker is new I guess. Not sure why they can't just carry it over from the old ticker. ](https://preview.redd.it/k7x08ikbnjn71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2276662802111eb202a624e980574e227c81ff63)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to make of the TMC ""today's changes"". For one, I don't know how accurate it is given the ticker change. But it could be that shorts are covering here.

# A word on IV, and Options vs Shares

MMs have already caught on to the deSPAC craze, so if you want to buy options, you'll have to pay for them. And by pay for them, I mean the fact that the float is very low and MMs have a hard time hedging is **already priced in**. So if you believe the low float is the catalyst for this thing to fly, then buying calls is essentially removing your alpha. If anything, you're betting against your own thesis.

This is the key difference with all of these deSPAC plays post-IRNT: MMs are aware that the float is low and so the option premiums have shot up. You can still make a decent buck with options if the underlying shoots up 10.00%+ or whatever... but the days of 10-baggers are over. Insteady, consider a larger bet on shares. It's very unlikely it goes to 0, but possible to see double digit percentage gains.

In other words: I'd rather gain 30% on a larger bet (and risk losing, say, 20% of it), than gain 100% on a smaller bet, but risk losing *all* of it.

# Social situation

I'd prefer to get this out quickly rather than write my commentary on the social situation. So I won't include full numbers of stocktwits, twitter mentions, etc.

Here's my brief take:

* Sentiment is rising on this one. It's one of the deSPACs that's actually moving
* Nearly the same set-up as IRNT, but with the twist of high short interest... which you know gets retail foaming at the mouth
* I don't see this getting onto WSB anytime soon, however the deSPAC craze has drawn a lot of eyes to other subreddits. So this could gain some traction
* Eyes are on IRNT (recently hit WSB), and ATER (I have no idea what this one is), and other deSPACs
* I think today's price action will draw more eyes to TMC.

# Other

I don't know what's behind today's price action:

* It could be a pump from social/other sub-reddits. If so, that shakes my confidence a bit.
* It could be from shorts covering. I think this is somewhat likely but can't really tell.
* It could be from MMs delta-hedging -- given the high IV, I don't think this is very likely, but there is a significant amount of OI on $10 calls.

I am bullish given how quickly the price on this thing can move with relatively low volume, so I'm confident a short squeeze or gamma squeeze will move this thing a lot.

Again, **I don't recommend options at this price.**

My positions (from 9-13-21)

* I have some Sep 17 $15 calls that I accumulated Friday which I'm slowly selling into the action today. I do not recommend buying them.
* I have a lot of shares.",StockMarket,"TMC - High Gamma, High Short Interest, but high IV (from 9-13-21)",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/pod1ld/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/,True,submission

2. Which language do you code and what do you use for backtesting and buy/alerts.

A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they’re really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.

Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.

If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares (I recommend using owner’s earnings) as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter. After all, they are your earnings.

Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset

### Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing

The investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise &amp; misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth. The information below is basic but important to understand. Many of you already know this, but a few don't and could benefit from it.

### What is investing?

Investing is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments — stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.

### What investing is not

Investing is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more [foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT) to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing — a recipe for disaster.

Likewise, statements such as “the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or ""Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy"" are worthless. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.

Investing in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up or some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.

### Become a landlord

To become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don’t sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.

*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*

### Many people speculate, few invest

Investing is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends ""long-term investors"" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the ""future"" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.

Instead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.

However, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this [chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800) says it all\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not",StockMarket,The biggest misconception about investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/p4vkhm/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/,True,submission

Anyone who's been following the last several editions of my posts, out of the most recent 25 tickers from the watchlist only one ticker is down more than 10%, SKLZ, which was noted as a risky earnings play. The majority of the other tickers are up between 1-5% while the market has returned roughly 2% to investors during the same time-period.

This doesn't include the multiple home-runs and bread-winners of the group that eventually reached **20-30% return**. These tickers are: **TLRY, CLF, PLTR, AMD, and FUBO**. I'm always asked when do I sell these positions? My answers are usually along the lines of:

* If the stock is in an uptrend, I'll sell when I'm up 20-30% and attempt to buy back in on a dip.
* If the stock has been consolidating or trading within a channel, I'll usually hold until I meet my profit target or if the trend breaks to the downside, creating a down-trend.
* If the chart looks like it's bottoming and creating a cup-and-handle technical pattern I'll hold until the cup is formed. There is always a chance the bottom falls out and stock drops further, which would change my attitude toward the position and force me to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

What's mentioned above are my profit and technical targets. There are also fundamentals that affect my position. For example, I was in on WISH with a $9 cost basis. If you go over the earnings call or transcript you'll hear the CEO say how net user retention was way down, lower than they expected it to be. Even though the company is still doing over 2.5 billion revenues TTM and only valued at $2.5 billion itself, I did not like the tone management used on the conference call. WISH has the potential to take off given the revenues they've achieved, but with how much they are spending on advertising compared to their customer's retention is somewhat alarming. My mantra is ""when in doubt, get out"".

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, these tickers I mention are my ""swing-trade"" list and I'm not looking to hold for more than a week to 6 months (6 months is still long for swing trades), but sometimes you need to be patient. I play roughly 60% of the tickers I mention depending if I'm able to get in on the setup or if I missed my opportunity, like if the stock opens +10% Monday morning and I didn't get in the week before.

&amp;#x200B;

# Chart Guidelines &amp; Terms

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Meme List

&amp;#x200B;

**Peloton - PTON**

https://preview.redd.it/pmz1wf7ndlh71.png?width=2558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ec5b3163f6914672131e63a169e5628196e6be

Peloton is back on my list this week and I DCA'd more shares on Friday's dip. The stock reversed down to $110 and earnings are coming up within the next 10 trading days. It's hitting soft support level at $110. In my opinion there will be hard support at $100 and $95 levels, but potential upside on positive earnings back to $150 area for a favorable risk/reward.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**CrowdStrike - CRWD**

*Processing img ayipw8bmdlh71...*

CRWD is a cyber-security company that has seen success throughout covid. The stock price slide 8% last week to provide a potential dip opportunity on this uptrend. The stock is up 30% since May and these pullbacks are healthy for the share price to consolidate before another leg up. CRWD trades at a rich valuation compared to competitors, but has seen outstanding growth. Earnings are coming up August 31 and could be volatile going into the next 2 weeks of trading.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Shopify - SHOP**

https://preview.redd.it/gssnpihldlh71.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=558f6a0da8bf28c539304ab691c50fe813a3fa3f

The e-commerce giant has been trading between $1,100 and $1,500 since December of 2020. The share price has touched back down from it's short-lived high of $1,650 against the 50 SMA of $1,500. If the uptrend remains in-tact I think we will get another bounce and continue to the upside, otherwise we could see further support at the $1,400 level and re-evaluate then.

&amp;#x200B;

# The BTFD List

&amp;#x200B;

**PubMatic - PUBM**

https://preview.redd.it/1vfgpqdkdlh71.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=400da5699ceb1138a1d7a0beecf0ffef3212318e

PUBM is a cloud infrastructure platform that allows real-time programmatic advertising transactions for internet content creators and advertisers. Revenues have been hit from the newly introduced regulations on 3rd-party tracking cookies, affecting most advertisers. PUBM may remain volatile for another 2 quarters until management is able to provide insight on adjustments they will be able to make going forward. For those with an appetite for risk, the current $30 support level may prove to be a dip-buying opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Generation - GRWG**

https://preview.redd.it/3jfixgqjdlh71.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23a670f6b10b873c7bd1b28c5b19770406779131

GrowthGeneration offers hydroponics and organic gardening equipment, mainly for the cannabis industry. GRWG just posted solid earnings with better than expected revenue growth. The downside? Analysts are forecasting Q3 and Q4 of 2021 to be softer than expected and the share price has dropped 30% last week. GRWG is trading back to December 2020 levels, almost 9 months of price appreciation destroyed in several days. Perhaps an over-reaction?

*HUGE consumer sentiment drop*

*Taliban-Afghanistan War*

*CPI and unemployment rate*  


&gt;*“Stocks and stones may light my bons” – Me*

  
Hey lazy stoners, we meet again.  
I re-rolled all the highlights of last week on the stock market as always.  


Last week still seems pretty steady and recovering faster than my hangover, despite the surging delta variant. It’s been a peaceful week and I expect the market to still go well. However, there’re a few signs worth keeping an eye on.  


# Consumer sentiment drops to the lowest reading since 2011

Huge drops like this have happened only six times over the past 50 years.Unfortunately, the rising concerns of the delta variant created another drop.  


However, as the vaccine is widely available and people are starting to get used to wearing masks, I personally think it’s not as bad as it looks.  


What do you guys think of it? Is it a sign of incoming correction?  


# Will the Taliban-Afghanistan war impact the market?

Based on past experience, investors tend to buy defense stocks after incidents like this happen. You may consider buying defense stocks as a way of helping out our homeland.  


In my opinion, I don't think it will make a difference.  


# Unemployment rate and CPI (Consumer Price Index)

Unemployment report had three straight drops in filings. The recovery of the labor market continues. Let’s check out our online shopping cart and get stoned for the country!  


CPI: +0.5% MoM, +5.4% YoY  


Core CPI: +0.3% MoM, +4.3% YoY  


PPI(Producer Price Index): +1.0% MoM, +7.8% YoY  


# My takes

The market is still at an all-time high.  


As investors are getting more cautious , some tiny bad news can shake the market easily. I expect the upcoming market to go up slowly and drop hard if any bad news comes up.  


If I missed anything important, feel free to let me know !

You see a stoner here investing? It’s called genius polished thinking.

In fact, I witnessed many people posting about short trades in which one cannot lose during that rally. The common perspective was that due to the highest Covid death rates being reported during the spring of 2020, economic shutdowns being seen all over the country, and record unemployment being reported, there was no way the market could continue to rally. It was simply impossible in most people’s minds.

Yet, continue to rally we did. Imagine if there was someone who warned you that we were going to 4000+ from the 2200SPX region, and who actually turned strongly bullish as we were hitting the lows. You would think that more and more people would be interested in what caused this person to maintain such a strong bullish bias in the face of utter despair.

&gt;*It is uncanny. Avi and his team are working their ass off - and they make incredible calls. The constantly tell you to unlearn everything you learned before, and most people struggle with this. I still do. But the more I embrace their trading style the greener my account gets. I mean, when a guy tells you that we will see SPX 3200+ in a few weeks/months in the middle of a crisis like corona, it is very hard to let go of your shorts. I wish I did,.. Well, today, when Avi tells me what he thinks is most probably going to happen and how,... I listen. And it is a pleasure to watch my balance grow.*

Well, instead, that person was called out for his “unmeaningful” perspective:

&gt;*Coming from someone who still thinks the bull market of January is alive enough to carry us to 4,000, that's highly unmeaningful... Here is the 2200 exactly that you said the S&amp;P would bottom at before taking the trip back up to 4,000... What do you want to bet the ECONOMY is going to pull it down a lot further and that 4,000 is a lot further away than your charts ever said... THIS bull market did not ever come close to taking us to 4,000, and it is not taking us anywhere ever again because it is DEAD. OFFICIALLY and in EVERY way. Every index is DEEPLY into a bear market now. The bull is dead, and so it can NEVER take us to 4000. What you predicted can NEVER come true now...* *my own resolution is that this market has a lot further to fall because it is now following the economy, which it long divorced itself from; whereas Avi doesn't believe the economy ever means anything to stocks and has told me so several times last year... So, you have that common sense view, or you can believe Avi's chart magic will get you through all of that and is right about a big bounce off of 2200 all the way back up to 4,000.*

Based upon history, it seems as though the “chart magic” seems to be winning.

But, have any of these other analysts or pundits learned from this experience? NOPE. In fact, they are all back at it again, claiming that the Delta variant or inflation is going to crash the market. So, as more and more Covid cases have been reported these last several weeks, the market has only gone . . . UP!

And, as for you inflation bugs, well, I suggest you look at the bond market, the gold market, as well as the crash in the lumber market, among many other factors not supporting the inflation perspective. But, to be honest, none of that is material, as that will never serve you well in maintaining on the correct side of the market trend. So, in truth, it is best to ignore both those factors, along with anyone else who tries to explain the market based upon those perspectives. They will continue to be wrong.

In fact, I am quite certain more writers and analysts will continue to write many, many more articles calling for a top or crash as the market continues to march higher in the coming year or two. This was actually my inspiration for the title to this current missive. They will continue to write bearish articles with many, many, many parts until the market actually tops several years out, and then claim “I told you so.”

Therefore, I am going to forewarn you. As you know, I am expecting a 200-300 point pullback. It will certainly make the bears growl. But, you should ignore the bears. This will simply be another buying opportunity. So, it may be best if you stop reading bearish authors, and stop listening to the financial news during the pullback. I can assure you that they will drive you towards the bearish views of the market, and prevent many of you from being able to buy the next pullback. And, while the news and pundits will certainly be bearish, the market is not.

Now, if you had been following our work, you would know that, despite being at the depths of despair when we were hitting the 2200SPX region in March 2020, we were calling for a bull market move with a minimum target of 4000, and with an ideal target of 6000SPX. While many thought this call to be nothing short of insane due to all “news” being reported at the time, we clearly have exceeded my minimum target, and we now have our sights on my ideal target. Therefore, the news was worse than meaningless. It actually significantly hurt your performance if you paid any heed to the news while making investment decisions over the last year and a half. Have you learned your lesson yet?

I know many of you are probably sick and tired of hearing me drone on and on about how one should ignore the news in order to increase your investment performance. And, the spring of 2020 was simply an extreme example of that upon which I rail almost weekly.

As we came into 2021, I outlined to those willing to listen that I expected at least a 20% continuation rally in the SPX, and I would prefer for us to strike at least the 4600SPX region this year. And, at the time, the SPX was in the 3750SPX region, so, again, many said to themselves “there goes crazy-Avi again.” Thus far, the market has provided us with a 19% rally in 2021, and I still would like to see us rally to 4600SPX within 2021.

I am going to take a moment to explain some of our Fibonacci Pinball methodology so that you can understand why I have expected us to rally to the 4440-4600SPX region before we see a 200-300 point pullback. First, for those that do not understand the basics of Elliott Wave, and our Fibonacci Pinball method of applying Elliott Wave, feel free to read through this [six-part series](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/market-update/Elliott-Wave-Series-Part-1-201808184848063.html) I wrote some time ago for our readers.

Assuming you now have a basic background in EW analysis, I will remind you that a bull market rallies in 5-wave structures, and corrects in 3-wave structures. Moreover, since the market is fractal in nature, meaning it is variably self-similar at all degrees of trend, waves 1, 3 and 5 within a 5-wave structure are comprised of 5-wave sub-structures as well.

With this understanding, we can add further to our knowledge base. Based upon our Fibonacci Pinball structure, wave 3 within wave \[3\] usually targets the 1.00-1.236 extension of waves \[1\] and \[2\]. In our case, that is the 4440-4600SPX region. And, for this reason, I was quite confident we would see at least 4440SPX before we saw that 200-300 point pullback I still expect.

Since we are in our target region, I am now going to make this rather simple for you. Micro support is 4423-35SPX. Should the market break below that support in the coming week, we have an initial signal that the wave 4 pullback has potentially begun. It becomes significantly more likely on a follow through below 4373SPX.

But, if we hold that support, and rally up to 4490SPX, then 4464SPX becomes our new support, and as long as all pullbacks then hold over that support, we are likely targeting the 4550SPX region in the coming weeks.

If you would prefer greater detail of our analysis on a daily basis as we track through this more convoluted wave structure, we provide that at ElliottWaveTrader. My current expectation remains that we see a 200-300 point pullback in the coming weeks, which will set up a rally to 4600+ later this year.

For most people, it means you should look for opportunities to raise some cash to take advantage of the pullback I think we will soon see. Keep in mind that I believe that the next major rally phase can take us to 4900/5000 after this next pullback completes.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that we provide our perspective by ranking probabilistic market movements based upon the structure of the market price action. And, if we maintain a certain primary perspective as to how the market will move next, and the market breaks that pattern, it clearly tells us that we were wrong in our initial assessment. But here is the most important part of the analysis: We also provide you with an alternative perspective at the same time we provide you with our primary expectation, and let you know when to adopt that alternative perspective before it happens.

As I have said many times before, this is no different than if an army general were to draw up his primary battle plans, and, at the same time, also draws up a contingency plan in the event that his initial battle plans do not work in his favor. It is simply the manner in which the general prepares for battle. We prepare for market battle in the same manner.

So, while I will never be able to tell you with certainty how the market will move in the coming weeks, months, and years, I present you with enough information to know where my primary perspective is wrong so that you can adjust in order to take account for the alternative situation. And, until such time that the market proves our primary perspective is wrong, we will continue to follow our primary perspective, which at this time is pointing us to much higher levels in the coming years.

By now, I hope you recognize the difference in our analysis approach, other than the accuracy thereof. We strive to view the market, and utilize our mathematically based methodology, in the most objective fashion as possible, no matter how crazy it may sound. Moreover, it provides us with objective levels for targets and invalidation. So, when we are wrong in the minority of circumstances, we are able to adjust our course rather quickly, rather than fighting the market like many others you may read have been doing during this entire rally off the March 2020 lows.

So, while I hope I am helping many of you in maintaining an objective perspective within this non-linear environment we call the stock market, I want to wish you all well in your future trading and investment endeavors. As of now, I maintain my long-held expectation to see the market in the 6000SPX region in the coming years, of course, unless the market tells us otherwise. But, please approach the market with the respect that a bull market deserves, as surprises usually come to the upside, and we likely have much higher to go before this bull market ends.",StockMarket,The Market Is About To Crash - Part XXIII (This Time We Mean It),https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/p5j2yz/the_market_is_about_to_crash_part_xxiii_this_time/,True,submission

If you have been around the stock markets since before COVID, what has transpired in the last 18 months or so can be a bit too much to take in. The new pandemic generation of investors hear them say “You kids don’t know what a real correction is like!” and walk away muttering “boomer!” Well, they’re not wrong, you know.

SPX (The Index for S&amp;P 500) has been consistently making new ATHs (all-time high) one after another at breakneck momentum, leaving most analysts in some degree of disbelief. Surely there has to be a correction at some point? What is driving this mania in the markets? Let’s try and figure this out!

**Inflation - The Fuel for the Fire**

When someone with the track record of Michael Burry warns you about an impending crash of huge magnitude, you should take notice. “The Big Short”, known for shorting the market during the housing crisis of 2008, has warned that catastrophic losses would follow if the prices of meme stocks and crypto currencies were to decline leading to a global economic crisis. There are many others who echo those sentiments.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmhnk3pw6rh71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b97423f1008de79e1d8967abb0a02d1e005067df

 

Burry was warning retail that the hype was all designed to lure the people in before what he called “the mother of all crashes” in a series of now deleted tweets. His words do have substance. It has in fact become evident with the 100% rally in S&amp;P since the COVID crash in 2020. Meme stocks and social media frenzy can drive the prices of certain stocks multifolds within a matter of days. People are becoming millionaires by investing in doge coins.

All of this has happened at a time when the economy has struggled across the globe and 2020 was a difficult year for most people professionally. A lot of it can be attributed to the relentless inflows of cash into the US economy by the Federal Reserve.

What was designed as a measure to keep the economy going has turned into a vicious inflationary cycle with prices shooting up across the board. While it worked in the short term, rapidly rising levels of inflation are never good in the long term for any participant in the economy – businesses or individuals.

The massive stimuli of cash – more than $5 trillion – has created inflated valuations of businesses and companies in both the traditional and crypto markets. The crypto markets have in fact already seen a massive correction of over 50% in most currencies in the months of May and June. Many people are calling the on-going rally a relief pump that marks the beginning of a longer bear market.

**How Should a Retailer Approach the Upcoming Months?**

As most traders would say to you, trend is your friend. Until proven otherwise, the market is in an upwards trend and that should define your approach. However, we are at the levels now where you should start being cautious. Maybe taking partial profits on your gains over the last 18 months wouldn’t be a bad idea. P&amp;L only counts when it is realized.

Also follow strict risk management and stop losses on all your positions. One must never underestimate the market or overestimate themselves. Your exposure must always be under control and never of the magnitude that it impacts your life.

As long as your risk is managed, trend is your friend. But as my favorite wizard Hagrid would say, “Careful, Harry!”",StockMarket,The Supercycle or A Bubble Waiting to Be Burst?,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/p5kk1u/the_supercycle_or_a_bubble_waiting_to_be_burst/,True,submission

This is my first ever attempt at posting a DD Reddit. I’m active in the market constantly, reading financials and dissecting SEC reports. I do not consider myself an expert, but I do spend a lot of time reading, understanding, and creating financial statements in my profession as accountant. I’ve been spending the past several years trying to apply this knowledge to the stock market.

One of my weaknesses in financial statements is the banking sector. They function much differently than most other businesses and, therefore, their financial statements are much different. However, I’ve been spending the last several months reading, researching, and learning how to understand them. So writing this DD is partially to share my thoughts and opinions on a stock I have analyzed and to, hopefully, get a little constructive criticism from some people who have some experience with the banking industry.

In the past year I have also been trying to identify good small and mid cap companies. I have large positions in lots of highly covered blue chip names and decided that it would be in my good interest to diversify my portfolio with some smaller companies that still have great fundamentals.

Anyways, here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

FS Bancorp is a banking company which primarily focuses on personal mortgage, home equity, home improvement, commercial real estate, and commercial business loans. It operates under the name of 1st Security Bank of Washington. They have 21 bank branches, 9 home loan production offices, and corporate headquarters, all based in or around the Washington state area. This is quite a small operation compared to the majority of the stocks covered on the internet, but there are good companies of all sizes.

High level, you can see their P/E is rather low at 6.60. Most major bank companies, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, all trade in the 11 - 13 range right now. The dividend yield is modest, but their dividend growth rate is very strong. Their 3 and 5 year dividend growth rates are 22.7% and 29.2%, respectively. I tend to focus much more on strong dividend growth rates such as this.

The following data was all collected from SEC filings as of 3/31/21. Income statement data is 12 month trailing (4/1/20 through 3/31/21).

After gathering this data and reviewing it, I converted it into more useful data via ratios.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jyxt65j1bib71.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1cca7b8c57275f9e38e901857586c2cea5afd5b

Now that all of the data is laid out, let's dive in.

My valuation ratios are set to show red when they don't meet my benchmarks shown above. I was surprised to find this company hit all of my ratio benchmarks.

My first stop is typically to compare the book value per share to the trading value. With banks, I have learned I don't like paying more than 150% of their book value for a share. A trading value at 126% is well within my buyable range.

Their ROE and ROA are very strong. The company makes good money based on their balance sheet values, indicating a high efficiency of use of the company's resources.

The rest of their ratios look good, as well. Their efficiency ratio indicates they earn a healthy margin of interest income on their interest earning asset. Their loan to deposit ratio is about right in line with my expectations and nonperforming loans is very low. An important note on the last two ratios - I factored out any SBA PPP loans since these will likely be almost entirely forgiven.

In addition to my financial analysis, the company has been consistently buying back shares for the past several years, growing their EPS year over year, and just commenced a 2:1 stock split. The only reason the company gave for the stock split was because they want to gain new investors while still buying back shares. As a potential shareholder, I like all of these things.

In summary, I find this to be a dividend growth company with a strong balance sheet, growing YOY earnings, and above average earnings on their assets. I would rate this company as a buy.

482,InsurViewChina,t2_csgheizw,1626419569,olbqys,10,/r/StockMarket/comments/olbqys/japans_pension_insurance_system_how_does_japan/,1,"Japan, as a country with a very serious aging problem, is deeply disturbed. According to a report by Spanish News, since the middle of the last century, the average median age of the world’s population has increased from 25 to 33 years old. Of course, not all regions have the same rate of aging. Among them, the median age in Japan has risen from 22 to 48 in 15 years \[1\]. Compared with other countries, Japan’s aging phenomenon is the most serious. Judging from the information released by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan in September 2019, Japan’s population of elderly people over 65 accounts for 28.4% of the total population, which is also the highest among 201 countries and regions in the world. In fact, as early as the 1970s, Japan entered an aging society.

In order to cope with the increasingly serious aging problem, while improving the pension system, Japan is also actively minimizing its impact on the economy.According to data released by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan, the number of senior employment under the aging situation has maintained an increasing trend for 15 consecutive years. In addition, according to relevant information in Japan, the retirement age of employees of Japanese companies is likely to be changed from 65 to 70.

On the other hand, the average life expectancy of Japanese citizens has been at a high level for years. It was once called by the US Times as the most suitable country for elderly care. How can the pension insurance system satisfy all parties under heavy pressure?

Japan’s pension insurance system is a traditional pension insurance system. The right of an individual to receive a pension is linked to payment obligation. And the pension level is related to the individual income. In addition to basic pensions, the country also encourages enterprises to implement supplementary pension insurance through preferential policies in taxation and interest, and strive to achieve a multi-level pension insurance system.

**Three levels of protection in Japan’s pension insurance system**

Japan’s pension insurance system is mainly divided into three levels, namely the national pension, employee annuity and enterprise annuity.

In 1959, the Japanese government promulgated the “National Pension Law”, which proposed that the state, industry, and individuals should share responsibility. It stipulates that all residents, who are 20 years old and under 60 years old and have residency rights in Japan, are obliged to participate in the national pension regardless of occupation. And they need to pay the corresponding insurance premiums, and after reaching a certain number of years, they could receive insurance benefits. For some elderly, disabled people who have no income, a non-paying welfare annuity system is adopted, and the cost will be borne by the country. As Japan’s most extensive old-age security system, the national pension is also called basic annuity, which is similar to Chinese pension.

The second layer of protection is the employee annuity. According to the different occupations of the insured, the employee annuity is divided into the welfare pension and fraternal annuity. As an important supplementary form of the Japanese pension insurance system, the employees’ welfare pension is targeted at formal employees of enterprises with more than five people. The payment amount is linked to the wages and bonuses of the insured person and is shared by the enterprise and employees. As the coverage of the employees’ welfare pension insurance is also relatively extensive, it and the national pension constitute the two pillars of the Japanese public pension system. The fraternal annuity is targeted at national civil servants, local civil servants, and private school faculty and staff.

The national pension and employee pension systems mentioned above have been regulated at the legal level and formed a framework of “national pension”. The concept is that young people who are working raise older generations, so they are also collectively referred to as public annuity. The emergence of the third-tier corporate annuity is to further increase people’s pension income. It is a voluntary pension insurance, but the prerequisite for joining is to participate in the first and second-tier pension insurance. There are national pension funds, welfare pension fund system, etc.

**Unique nursing care insurance system**

In addition to the basic three-tier structure of the old-age insurance system mentioned above, there are many related insurance systems that escort the life of the elderly in Japan, including the medical insurance system for the elderly, the nursing care insurance system, and the nursing labor insurance system. The most distinctive feature is the nursing care insurance system, which is also quite recognized by the elderly. According to data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, in January 2019, the number of people receiving nursing care insurance pension services in Japan exceeded 5 million, of which 3.81 million received home care services\[2\].

In order to solve the problem of long-term care for the elderly through market regulation, Japan passed the Nursing Care Insurance Law in December 1997 and implemented it in April 2000 to help families reduce pension expenditures and prevent children from going out, leaving parents unattended. The so-called nursing care refers to the nursing and care of the elderly, providing assistance to people who have difficulties living independently on the basis of respecting their human rights. The content of the service can be roughly divided into two types of home services and institutional services to improve the nursing care. The insured can realize the value of his/her life to the maximum extent.

**Nursing care insurance system: strict review and classification**

The nursing care insurance system includes people who live in Japan and are 40 years of age or older as the target of financing. Seniors over 65 are classified as the first insured, and 40 to 65 years old are the second insured. This service is available when the old reaches 65 years of age or older, and the second insured can also enjoy this service ahead when they suffer from early dementia and other 15 diseases. After qualified users submit an application, they will enter the review and confirmation process. Different levels of care are judged, and the different services users can enjoy. After providing care services for half a year, relevant agencies will re-examine and confirm the health status of the care recipients to ensure the rational use of resources. In terms of costs, 50% of the cost is borne by the country, 40% is borne by the care insurance paid in various places, and only 10% of the cost is borne by individuals.

It is precisely because of the relatively complete social security system that the elderly in Japan are now more inclined to live at home, and they can also live more decently without leaving their familiar environment.

In addition to the continuous improvement of the system, the elderly care institutions in Japan are also very mature. They are roughly divided into two categories. One is the nursing care institutions that provide day care and other services, and the other is residential elderly care institutions. In addition to providing nursing care services, life services can also be provided. In addition to home care for the elderly, Japan also has a community care model. Suncity, developed on the basis of the CCRC in the United States, has become a representative of Japan’s high-end elderly care community.

After the above introduction, it is not groundless that Japan is known as the most suitable country for the elderly. The establishment of a sound legal system and the provision of related nursing services have provided protection for the elderly to the greatest extent. Among them, the National Pension Law has undergone many revisions and reforms since its implementation. After that, the nursing insurance system and other social security systems were put forward to better solve the pension problem, and the government’s responsibility in it has also increased.

Therefore, in the face of the trend of aging and declining birthrate, the government’s financial pressure will follow. More people need to receive pensions, but fewer pensioners. The pension industry is facing not only this challenge. According to media reports, the world’s largest pension fund GPIF (Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund) announced that it had lost a record 17.71 trillion yen from January to March due to the new crown pandemic. The loss of the pension fund has also aroused widespread concern in the Japanese society, because social security is still an important issue involving millions of retirees. In addition, the shortage of related nursing human resources has become one of the problems that the government has to handle. In the case of a serious shortage of labor force, Japan lowered the work visa standard in 2019. But on the other hand, with technology development, we have also seen more possibilities for the development of science and technology, and believe that it will make up for the supplement of manpower to a large extent.

**Some enlightenment for other countries**

**Perfect social security system**

For the development of any thing, the most basic law and the integrity of its related systems are the foundation. In addition to the “National Pension Law”, the “Life Protection Law”, “Elderly Welfare Law” and other bills have helped Japan establish a social security system shared by the state, society, and individuals. The elderly’s retirement life is no longer just a matter only for a family. The whole society is working hard for it, and in order to keep pace with the times and solve emerging problems, Japanese bills are constantly being revised and reformed to ensure the rational use of resources.

After having a complete social security system, implementation becomes the second most critical link. For example, when relevant qualifications are reviewed, the relevant regulations should be strictly followed, and the elderly should be graded.

**Professional nursing staff and the provision of differentiated services**

As mentioned above, with the improvement of Japan’s social security system, its elderly care industry has become more abundant. There are many related elderly care institutions, which can fully meet the needs of different elderly people, and ordinary elderly people can enjoy appropriate services. Patients suffering from Alzheimer disease can also get the protection that suits them. At the same time, elderly apartments, nursing care institutions, community service centers, etc. can make people no longer have to work hard to find suitable old-age care methods. In addition, Japan also has stricter requirements for the qualifications of personnel engaged in related nursing work. Different from the current uneven quality of personnel providing related services in China, Japanese relevant staff need to undergo professional training, and the work content also adopts a hierarchical system. Different levels of personnel undertake different tasks.

With aging sweeping the world, the development of the elderly care industry has gradually attracted everyone’s attention, and it has also attracted all walks of life. Among them, insurance, as an industry closely related to elderly care, is also exploring more possibilities. Under the interlocking of insurance + medical treatment + pension, more innovative products can be launched, as well as a coordinated upstream and downstream service chain to contribute insurance power to the pension industry.

* [**PYPL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PYPL?p=PYPL)\-1.41%
* [**SQ**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ)\-1.61%
* [**INTU**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTU?p=INTU)\-0.47%

Now could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy Square stock ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) as it transforms into a financial services powerhouse, argues Muzuho analyst Dan Dolev. 

""We believe Cash App may be en route to becoming the ultimate neo-bank and the money center bank of the future. This could make buying SQ analogous to buying J.P. Morgan in 1871,"" Dolev wrote in a new research note to clients. 

Dolev reiterated his Buy rating and $380 price target on Square. The company's stock currently trades at $238, up about 8% on the year, according to [Yahoo Finance Plus data](https://www.yahoo.com/plus/finance?ncid=editoriald_yhm5ec0oo8o). 

At the heart of Dolev's call is Square evolving into the bank of the future via its Cash App, one that essentially becomes the financial hub for consumers. Currently, the Cash App offers payment services, stock trading and the ability to buy bitcoin. 

""We view Cash App as the ultimate challenger bank. Our detailed build of potential products shows a clear path from Cash App's current $40-50 average revenue per user (ARPU) to $150-200 over the coming years by adding products that range from tax services, to insurance, to home equity lending"" Dolev said.

Dolev expects Square to add products that range from tax services, to insurance, to home equity lending on the Cash App. In turn, the Cash App could turn into a true money-maker for Square...no pun intended.

Continued Dolev, ""We believe that with 30 \[million\]-40 million active users, Cash App currently taps less than 10% of its potential user base. We estimate that the U.S. bank account TAM \[total addressable market\] is 400 \[million\]-500 million accounts. This implies more than 10x potential upside to its user base. Conservatively assuming Square reaches 15% penetration of the total U.S. bank account TAM (\~70 million active users, up from 36 million in December 2020), coupled with ARPU \[average revenue per user\] of $175 (midpoint of $150-200), points to nearly $12 billion in medium term gross profit potential. This is \~6x above Cash App's 1Q21 gross profit run rate of \~$2 billion.""

**Programming note:** Dolev will be on [Yahoo Finance Live](https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/) at 9:00 a.m. today to discuss his big call on Square.

**Wayne Duggan** Thu, July 15, 2021, 3:13 PM

**It has been a roller coaster year for Robinhood users.**

Popular trading app Robinhood and its investors are once again in the spotlight heading into the third quarter after the company officially filed for its highly anticipated [initial public offering](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-ipo-this-year?slide=3) in late June. Robinhood reported nearly 18 million active users in its filing and about $80 billion in assets. The company also estimates nearly half of all new U.S.-funded retail accounts opened from 2016 and 2021 were Robinhood accounts. The relatively young and inexperienced Robinhood trader base has had some huge hits and misses in recent quarters. Here are the eight most popular stocks owned by Robinhood users.

**Ford Motor Co. (ticker:** [**F**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/f-ford-motor-co)**)**

[Electric vehicle stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-ev-stocks-and-battery-companies) are extremely popular among young investors, but legacy automaker Ford is the top holding among Robinhood users in the third quarter. Ford's recently launched Mustang Mach-E EV has been a massive success and even won Car and Driver's 2021 EV of the Year award in early July. In May, Ford upped its planned investment in EV and autonomous vehicle technology from $22 billion to $30 billion through 2025. Ford trades at a much more compelling valuation than leading EV startup stocks, and the company generated $3.3 billion in net income in the first quarter.

**Tesla (**[**TSLA**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/tsla-tesla-inc)**)**

Robinhood investors are going all-in on the future auto market, and Tesla is the early EV market leader. Tesla reported an impressive 73.5% revenue growth in the first quarter, but critics point out that the company's core auto business is still not profitable without help from regulatory credit sales. Tesla was a huge winner for Robinhood investors in 2020, finishing the year up about 700%. Unfortunately, Tesla is down about 10% year to date amid rising EV competition. Piper Sandler recently estimated that Tesla will still maintain a 10.1% share of the global EV market by 2040.

**Apple (**[**AAPL**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc)**)**

Year in, year out, iPhone maker [Apple](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-and-cons-to-buying-apple-aapl-stock) continues to be one of the most profitable companies and consistent performers in the market. After reporting $57.4 billion in net income and $274.5 billion in revenue last year, Apple reported 53.6% revenue growth and 110% net income growth in the first calendar quarter of 2021. Apple shares gained 80.7% in 2020 and are up another 14% so far in 2021. Apple is shifting away from relying on hardware sales by increasing its high-margin recurring services revenue mix, and aggressive stock buybacks will continue to support Apple's earnings per share.

**AMC Entertainment Holdings (**[**AMC**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amc-amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a)**)**

AMC Entertainment has been one of the most controversial yet best-performing stocks in the market in 2021. Entering the year, AMC was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy after generating a $4.59 billion net loss in 2020. However, Reddit's [WallStreetBets](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-reddit-stocks-gaining-buzz) and other communities of online retail stock traders adopted AMC as one of their most loved ""meme"" stocks of the year, sending AMC soaring to new all-time highs in June. AMC has taken advantage of the enthusiasm by aggressively selling shares to stay afloat, increasing its outstanding share count by 383% since the beginning of 2020.

**Sundial Growers (**[**SNDL**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/sndl-sundial-growers-inc)**)**

There's no question U.S. cannabis legalization and global expansion are incredible long-term bullish catalysts for Sundial Growers and other [cannabis stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-marijuana-stocks-to-buy). However, Sundial has reported negative revenue growth in each of the past three quarters and has been consistently burning through cash. Sundial had to sell stock to replenish its balance sheet, and its outstanding share count is up a whopping 1,640% since the beginning of 2020. Sundial is one of the highest-risk cannabis stocks. The Sundial gamble has paid off well for Robinhood investors in 2021 given the stock is up 50% year to date.

**General Electric Co. (**[**GE**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ge-general-electric-co)**)**

General Electric is proof that Robinhood investors aren't all about meme stocks and high-flying growth investments. GE was one of the best American investments of the 20th century. But in recent years, GE ran into major problems with slowing growth, mounting debt and even an accounting investigation. GE has been selling non-core assets to fix its ailing balance sheet. GE has refocused on four industrial segments the company believes will lead to sustainable earnings growth: power, [renewable energy](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/renewable-energy-stocks-to-consider), aviation and health care. GE hasn't reported positive revenue growth since 2016, but Robinhood investors are optimistic about the turnaround efforts.

**NIO (**[**NIO**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nio-nio-inc-adr)**)**

NIO is one of a handful of U.S.-listed stocks that provide Robinhood investors exposure to the rapidly growing and potentially massive EV market in China. NIO recently reported 111.9% growth in vehicle deliveries in the three months ending in June 2021. However, the stock is down more than 12% so far in July as Chinese regulators have cracked down on U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. NIO has tremendous long-term upside, but it's not for the faint of heart given the uncertain regulatory outlook and the stock's lofty valuation at more than 20 times sales.

**The Walt Disney Co. (**[**DIS**](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/dis-walt-disney-co-the)**)**

The stay-at-home environment in 2020 crushed Walt Disney's theme parks, cruise lines and TV and film production businesses, but it was a major tailwind for its Disney+ streaming service, which launched in November 2019. Disney's legacy businesses will certainly recover in 2021 and beyond, making the stock a compelling [economic reopening](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/buy-rated-reopening-stocks-with-easy-comps) play. As of the second quarter, Disney+ had 103.6 million global subscribers, while Disney's ESPN+ service had 13.8 million subscribers and its Hulu service had another 41.6 million subscribers. Robinhood investors likely see those three direct-to-consumer services as the core of the long-term Disney bull thesis.

[**ALLISON GATLIN**](https://www.investors.com/author/gatlina/)  4:21 PM  07/15/2021

Biogen stock tumbled Thursday after the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai said they won't administer the company's controversial Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm.

Remember, chart patterns don't mark the end of the run, they mark the beginningVolume 0% 

In a statement emailed to Investor's Business Daily, the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic said a panel of experts reviewed the scientific data associated with **Biogen**'s ([**BIIB**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) aducanumab, the test name for Aduhelm.

""Based on the current data regarding its safety and (effectiveness), we have decided not to carry aducanumab at this time,"" the clinic said. ""However, we support continued research in this area and, when additional data become available, we will then re-evaluate this medication for use in our patients.""

New York-based Mount Sinai said its group of Alzheimer's experts is writing out best practices for Aduhelm while another group is putting together formulary addition protocols. The clinic also awaits the outcome of an Office of Inspector General investigation into Aduhelm's approval.

""The FDA's approval of Aduhelm has raised serious concerns and questions by clinicians, patients and caregivers and a cautious approach is required,"" Mount Sinai said in a statement emailed to IBD. ""Mount Sinai Health System will not administer Aduhelm until the outcome of the FDA Inspector General's Investigation of Biogen is complete. Depending on this outcome, if appropriate, our experts will follow formulary addition protocols and consider best practices for Aduhelm to inform clinical practice.""

On the [**stock market today**](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Biogen stock skidded 6.8% to 328.16.

**Biogen Stock Dives On Coverage Issues**

The fact two notable medical centers won't administer Aduhelm doesn't bode well for adoption. Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed questioned whether others might follow suit. This could put expectations for $9 billion in peak Aduhelm sales at risk, he said in a note to clients.

It's also another move pressuring Biogen stock this week.

Biogen said it remains committed to helping appropriate patients access Aduhelm.

""Medical decisions should be based on science and data, so it is disappointing that patients living with Alzheimer's Disease may reportedly not be able to access Aduhelm at some facilities,"" the company said in a statement emailed to IBD. ""Biogen continues to stand 100% behind Aduhelm and the clinical data that supported approval.""

The company also referenced comments from Janet Woodcock, acting Food and Drug Administration commissioner, during Stat's Breakthrough Science Summit on Wednesday. She said the approval was ""based on very solid grounds"" and ""the right thing to do for patients.""

But, according to Stat News, Woodcock also acknowledged the FDA could have handled the approval process differently to minimize the controversy. The FDA approved Aduhelm using an accelerated pathway that gives Biogen nine years to run a study confirming the drug's benefit on cognition. An advisory committee earlier voted against recommending the approval.

**Medicare Decision Expected In 2022**

Also this week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began the process to determine if it will cover Aduhelm. This process, called a national coverage determination, could limit the number of patients eligible to receive Medicare reimbursement for Aduhelm.

Medicare expects to have a final decision within nine months. In the meantime, local contractors in 12 regions will determine [**coverage for their areas**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-to-review-coverage-for-new-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-11626130325), according to The Wall Street Journal.

Medicare reimbursement will be key. Without it, many patients will be responsible for the drug's $56,000 annual price tag. It's still unclear who will foot the bill for the costly scans to check for beta amyloid in patients' brains. Aduhelm removes the ""sticky"" plaque associated with Alzheimer's.

But the Cleveland Clinic's decision wasn't based on the price tag, Mizuho's Syed said. He reiterated his neutral rating and 244 price target on Biogen stock.

""It's based on the data, not even financials, which I thought was interesting,"" he said.

Best buy is an international consumer electronic retailer that operates through physical and online stores.  They were incorporated in Minnesota in 1966.  They specialize in selling computers, mobile devices, televisions, cameras, wearables, audio products, and home appliances.  They have 1,126 large format stores, 33 small format stores and employ approximately 100 thousand people.

**Management overview:**

Corie Barry (CEO): She has a 21 year history with best buy.  Before that her only employment was two years at deloitte. 91% of employees approve of the CEO

The general sentiment from glassdoor is that management listens and employees are treated well.  Even the worst reviews generally approve of management.  It looks like there are different opinions from store to store. Some of the better ones say that there is a lot of support from other employees, while the worst ones say that other employees are rude.  There is talk among many reviews that long hours standing up gets very exhausting after being employed for long periods.

Best buy’s target market is most retail users looking for non specific or generic electronics.  They can offer customized products, but lack a competitive advantage to the manufacturers as manufacturers often offer cheaper prices if you customize and order a product online.

## Risk

There are a number of risks associated with the industry.  Before listing out some of the risks identified by best buy itself.

The nature of the electronics industry is very competitive.  Even if best buy can acquire products with volume discounts, they should still be expected to have lower margins than the manufacturer as long as best buy implements its price matching protocols.

 One important component of their business is the physical experience for customers with higher end products.  [Customers still prefer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171116005542/en/June20-Study-65-Percent-of-Americans-Prefer-Shopping-at-Physical-Stores-to-See-and-Touch-a-Product-Before-Purchasing) to see items in person before they purchase them, and this preference is probably generally stronger the more expensive a purchase is. In addition to this, [computers and other electronics are delicate](https://youtu.be/RBv3HJ7y1Rs). Based on this, some or most consumers may feel more comfortable seeing their electronics and verifying its condition before they make a purchase.  If these assumptions are true, then buying from best buy compared to buying online is like purchasing antique china online versus from an antiques dealer.  Best buy may have this advantage now, but if more retailers that are manufactured or can get better deals from manufacturers realize this and can open physical stores profitably, best buy could lose their advantage and will quickly go out of business. 

They currently have an advantage over other physical retailers because of their focus on a narrow group of products and employee expertise in the given lines of products. If physical competitors can build up better varieties of consumer electronics and employ better informed employees, best buy could lose its competitive advantage.

Some of the notable risks the company has identified:

* Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.
* We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.
* We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season

I will go over Microsoft stores in the weakness section.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments:

90% of sales come from inside the United States.  Sales are broken down into the following categories

* Computing and Mobile Phones: 47% of revenue
* Consumer electronics: 30%
* Appliances: 10%
* Entertainment: 8%
* Services: 4%
* Other: 1%

## Industry position

Many of best buys competitors are much larger retailers with many more product categories.  Competitors are retailers rather than manufacturers, because although BBY competes for sales with the manufacturers, the manufacturers are also suppliers and in that sense have complete control over the competition.

Major direct competitors are Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, Costco and target.  Best buy is the smallest of these, and has the lowest P/E, PEG, P/S, P/C, and P/FCF ratios.  Their P/B is higher than Alibaba and walmart.   They have the highest dividend, ROE, and ROI out of their competitors and the second highest ROA, current ratio, second lowest D/E. They have a low profit margin, but it is average compared to competitors.

Their industry position is strong. But they address a much smaller share of consumer purchases compared to their retail competitors due to their narrower line of business.  They have an advantage for now in this narrow line of business, clearly supported by their current relative position to competitors.  Unfortunately, it would be much easier for the physical competitors to improve their consumer electronics segments than it would be for best buy because best buy already has established relationships and trained employees in the sector so there's not much more improvements that can be made.

## Overview/Growth and Developments

* They have slow revenue growth, and a consistent but low earnings
* Their profit margin is low but consistent
* They slowly buy back shares and occasionally issue them, but the overall trend is more buying back than issuing. YoY annual buybacks account for about 1-2% of shares outstanding on average
* They have an A- credit rating, not bad, not great.  
* Gross margin is consistently around 25%.​​​
* They repeatedly keep a lot of current liabilities and little debt on their balance sheet. Historically they have always been able to adequately cover obligations
* Looking at their past trends, It would be reasonable to say that they could be expected to grow at 5% per year.
* They historically do not keep a lot of cash on hand.  
* They have no notable legal proceedings.
* There is nothing notable about them recently in the news.

## Catalyst

It is extremely unlikely that there would be any massive changes in the business other than being acquired in a year's time.  If they decide to sell say groceries or sports equipment tomorrow, it would take a long time for them to create the proper conditions for the new products to be sold. That being said, if they did decide to do something like this, I am quite confident that they would implement it properly to add real good value to shareholders, just like they have integrated newer products into their business. 

Best Buy online has the advantage of being able to supply hardware inventory to customers looking for very specific parts.  If Best Buy can expand their physical hardware retail segment to sell a larger variety of chips and other components for PC building and repair, that would attract some serious value as they would be one of the first major retailers to do so.  

## Strengths &amp; Weaknesses

Best buy’s most direct competition are arguably radio shack in america and the source in canada (RIP future shop).  If any of you have been into either the source or radio shack, it is obvious that they are far behind best buy as physical retailers. Apple stores may take away from apple product sales at best buy but best buy has realized this and replaced some retail space with PCs that was once occupied by apple products.  In the physical realm, best buy has a huge advantage and will continue to have this advantage as long as people are skeptical of delivery people and making large purchases without seeing the product.

Best buy has the ability to expand into sub sectors of tech that are continuously emerging and sometimes disappearing.  For their salespeople, selling printers or whatever new technology pops up in the next five years will probably be much easier than if a Walmart salesperson was in the same position. I hate to even hear the word IOT, but it is quite likely that best buy will consider or be involved in the next ‘smart’ device.  

Microsoft stores pose a risk to best buy, even if they are all closed.  They carried a smaller variety of products that fit into the same category that 47% of best buys sales. Unlike best buy, Microsoft has tremendous capital inflows and they are able to open up 100s of stores without being close to setting off financial alarms.  Microsoft has closed all of its past retail locations, but that's not to say that if their management gets bored and has a couple billion lying around, they could really disrupt best buys market if they decide to sell more than just their own products. (Apple stores cost 8.3-10M, so I am assuming MSFT stores cost $10M each).

They are a high revenue business, but you would be an embarrassment to an analyst if you look at the revenue figures and immediately come to a conclusion about the business. Profit margins are not great.  The balance sheet structure is odd and cash flows are small.  They aren't drowning in debt but they also aren’t keeping their coffers very full.  They pay too high a dividend and buyback too many shares when they should be building up more useful cash reserves. On this note, earnings do not adequately cover current obligations, and they historically have not.  The majority of obligations seem to be inventory based.  Just under half of current assets are inventory, and about 65% of current liabilities are accounts payable. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together here. 

## Valuation

My valuation of best buy gives them a margin of safety between -10% to 30%.  They have a good business, and they have predictable customers, but they have lacked growth and profitability that would be expected from a company with the status of their competition.  It could just be bringing profit margins to 6%.  Their return on equity/assets/investments doesn't really mean much more than a nice thing to look at.  The returns they are getting are not actually staying in the company.  They are being used to pay off whatever obligation they have next up on the list.  It's the classic romantic tragedy where a beautiful thing is corrupted by some arbitrary sin - their sin being that they are trying to sell products at a very competitive price without recognizing that the price won’t wreck the business if it creeps up a little bit each year.

## Opinion

I like best buy more than I like my wife.  They have the size and the potential to become much more valuable, but it’s a decision only their financial management can make. They are in a position they have been in for a long time.  It's a vulnerable position where they lack any ability to lower profit margins healthily. Sure, they've done fine in the past decade, and from the looks of it they could be fine in the next decade. But the risk associated with their vulnerability is high if management is incompetent.  I would buy best buy, but I wouldn't put my whole portfolio in them. It i could, I would buy the whole business outright and start increasing products offered in physical stores as long as it can be done safely and also start bringing prices up nice and slow.  They would be a business I would be more happy to own than many more financially stable companies.  But unfortunately I cannot buy all of best buy, and corporate management is often more bureaucratic and greedy than not. 

 I would rate them a hold unless they replace the CEO with a more aggressive character but can still listen to the CFO and the rest of management without any issues.  The CFO is a bit of a man of mystery. I can't find out a lot about him, but it is clear he can do better.  A new CFO from a background of successful mature growth and expansion would work wonders for the company.  If I see some shifts in management that I like, I would be very happy to make them 20% of my portfolio.

 **FreightWaves Thu, July 15, 2021, 4:05 PM**

**In this article:**

* [**TSLA**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA)\-0.78%

&amp;#x200B;

[Elon Musk](https://preview.redd.it/eye5jjthilb71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e3e2a30ddfb32fbead27537682a48126018c3ce)

Love him or hate him, Elon Musk is a lightning rod for analysts. His efforts have been both praised for their visionary approach (Tesla electric automobiles; Boring Co.) and derided as distractions (Tesla Semi, SolarCity).

**Morgan Stanley** (NYSE: [MS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MS)) analysts believe Musk should, and will, add another side project — electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) craft.

""We must acknowledge that **Tesla** (NASDAQ: [TSLA](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TSLA)) management has, to date, openly discouraged speculation around their involvement in eVTOL/UAM. So, that's it then. ... We'll have Teslas on our roads, underground in tunnels ... on Mars. But not in Earth's skies? Well ... we're not convinced,"" the authors of the report wrote.

[Morgan Stanley](http://www.morganstanley.com/) has initiated an overweight rating on Tesla with a price target of $900 per share that it said did not factor in aviation-related benefits. A Tesla Aviation division could add between about $100 based on a 4% Tesla eVTOL market share and 25% EBITDA margin up to $866 based on 20% market share and 40% EBITDA margin.

The analysis is based on the research firm's projections of a $9 trillion global[ total addressable market](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/flying-cars-set-for-slow-takeoff-rapid-ascent) (TAM) for eVTOLs by 2050.

Tesla did not respond to a Modern Shipper request for comment on the report.

""While we believe there are many important areas of technology and business models where Tesla has transferable skills to the UAM market, we do not include any value of addressing this market in our Tesla price target at this time. We also do not anticipate UAM/eVTOL to be on the 2021 ‘priority list' for the company at this point. However, we urge investors to consider the potential opportunities for Tesla and other automotive OEMs,"" Morgan Stanley's note pointed out.

One of the underpinnings of the analysis is the number of transferable skills Tesla has developed through its various projects and manufacturing prowess. It cited Tesla's expertise in electric motors, battery and autonomy development, as well as vertical manufacturing, networking, and software and communications experience.

This is not the first time Morgan Stanley has[ promoted a Tesla project](https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-likes-the-idea-of-a-tesla-semi-truck-2017-4), or perceived Tesla project. In April 2017, analyst Adam Jonas sent out a note about the unveiling of the Tesla Semi, noting, ""We believe the Tesla truck opportunity is real and is a natural market adjacency to the personal transport model.""

At the time, Jonas said it was tough to envision the Semi being worth more than 10% of Tesla's market cap.

Since that time, Tesla has solved some of its manufacturing issues that were hampering automobile production, but a Semi still has not entered production.

**Crowded marketplace**

While the idea of Tesla entering the eVTOL market is the highlight of the Morgan Stanley report, more space is dedicated to an analysis of the overall market for eVTOLs — rehashing most of what the firm first detailed in its May 6[ ""eVTOL/Urban Air Mobility TAM Update: A Slow Take-Off, But Sky's the Limit](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/flying-cars-set-for-slow-takeoff-rapid-ascent)"" report.

One of the reasons many, including Morgan Stanley, are bullish on eVTOLs is the number of companies working on them, including [Hyundai](http://www.hyundai.com/) and [**General Motors**](http://www.gm.com/) (NYSE: [GM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GM)), as well as a host of startups. At the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show, Hyundai introduced its [flying car concept](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ces-2020-uber-partners-with-hyundai-for-developing-flying-taxis), the S-A1. The vehicle would have the capacity for up to four passengers and travel 60 miles at speeds of up to 180 mph.

Earlier this month, [Eve Urban Air Mobility](http://www.eveairmobility.com/) and Helisul Aviation announced a joint effort to create an ecosystem-wide approach to UAM in Brazil, which is racing to embrace the technology. The deal will result in up to 50 eVTOLs operating in the country by 2026. Eve is backed by noted aircraft maker Embraer.

Also, Lilium[ unveiled a seven-seat eVTOL](https://www.aviationtoday.com/2021/03/30/lilium-reveals-new-7-seater-evtol-merger-qell/) earlier this year as well as a merger with Qell Acquisition Corp. to take the eVTOL maker public in a SPAC deal. Joby Aviation just announced a deal with **JetBlue** (NASDAQ: [JBLU](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JBLU)) to[ develop electric eVTOLs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210713005619/en/Joby-Aviation-JetBlue-and-Signature-Announce-Pathway-to-Utilization-of-Electric-and-Hydrogen-Aviation-Credits).

**Overweight Rating Issued**

Morgan Stanley laid out bull, bear and base cases for Tesla stock, offering a range of $450 to $1,272 per share, excluding any potential eVTOL impact.

""We believe the next two to three years of EV growth will largely be dictated by who has access to the greatest volume of low-cost batteries, reliably sourced,"" the firm said. ""Using a bread truck analogy for battery cells, we think successful EV players will be the ones closest to the bread truck. Tesla owns the bakery.""

Tesla stock was down slightly in morning trading to $650.89 a share at noon ET. It is off about 28% from its January highs.

The bull case Morgan Stanley lays out assumes Tesla is delivering 8 million vehicles by 2030 and the firm is generating sufficient revenue from mobility/ridesharing, energy, supply of EV powertrains to third parties, and related services, including insurance and connected fleet software. The bear case assumes Tesla's EV sales fall in line with other OEMs and Tesla Mobility achieves only half of the projected valuation with all other areas also falling below expectations.",StockMarket,Where's Elon?

Volatility in the markets continued today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Ever since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

On a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, “*""*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday’s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.""

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the “rear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.”
* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services”. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”
* Tesla (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from research firm Cross-Sell
* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

I personally think we are overvalued, in terms of stocks real estate etc... I don't think crypto is currently. My main topic of discussion-  Considering the fact that we currently are printing so much money, there is crazy inflation going around. There is also a lot of extra income via stimulus checks and other government spending to try to help the US recover. The extra income is putting billions and billions of extra money into the market, which is one of the reasons for these amazing gains we have had. That money will stop coming in eventually. The amount of retailers playing the game has increased a lot. Which is good, until it isn't. I think these things also was a major reason for the crypto crash. Anybody have any thoughts?

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

# **Earnings could be the biggest driver for markets in the week ahead as investors watch bonds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/earnings-could-be-the-biggest-driver-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-watch-bonds.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks enter a busy week for earnings news with two perplexing questions hanging over the market.
*****
&gt; One is whether the big gains in corporate profits will start to boost stocks with solid earnings reports. That was not the case for some financial sector stocks this past week. The other question is whether the surprise decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield is sending a message that stock investors should heed.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.30% Friday, after dipping below that level on Thursday. Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.
*****
&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.
*****
&gt; “Earnings have the spotlight in the coming week,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “You’re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.”
*****
&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings
&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; “I think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,” he said. “We’re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.”
*****
&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.
*****
&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight
&gt; “I think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,” Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.
*****
&gt; “I think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall — but particularly equity investors,” said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.
*****
&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.
*****
&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; “What the heck is it telling us? The fears are it’s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it’s not going to be near as good as people thought,” said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there’s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.
*****
&gt; “Our belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,” he said. “I think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it’s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.”

&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery

&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses’ ability to expand.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words had declined slightly while “weak” words fell to their lowest level since the BBB’s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.

&gt; “The economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.” (For more on LPL Research’s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.

&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation

&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.

&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed’s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.

&gt; This may surprise some given CPI’s and PPI’s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.

&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.

&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.

&gt; Fed Chair Powell’s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in “active consideration” over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.

&gt; “The composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Just how long ‘transitory’ will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.”

&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed’s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed’s characterization of inflation as transitory.

&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.

&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be “stickier” than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly

&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the ""mega-cap"" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)

&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

&gt; While RSP has been trading sideways for the past couple of months, it's actually still slightly ahead of SPY on a year-to-date basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytdchg.png))**

&gt; As shown below, RSP's YTD lead over SPY has been declining rapidly since peaking in May/June, however.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytd.png))**

&gt; It's the last two months that have caused RSP to give up nearly all of its 2021 outperformance versus SPY. As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspy2mth.png))**

&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.

&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.

&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**

&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.

 **KEY POINTS**

* **Square is creating a new business dedicated to “decentralized finance,” or DeFi, applications for bitcoin.**
* **DeFi applications rely on smart contracts rather than banks or other third parties to execute transactions.**

**In this article**

* [**SQ-0.09** **(-0.04%)**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SQ)

Payments company [Square](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SQ) is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services” using bitcoin.

Square CEO and bitcoin bull Jack Dorsey [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765941904941061) late Thursday that the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”

The new unit will include the Seller, Cash App and recently acquired Tidal businesses.

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications are those that don’t rely on centralized authorities like banks, but instead use blockchain-based smart contracts to execute transactions. Most are being built on the Ethereum blockchain.

DeFi applications allow for financial transactions that are more easily accessible, efficient and relatively low cost. They’ve also been highly attractive to yield seekers who can generate returns between about 15% and 30% by participating in the DeFi ecosystem – by “locking” capital in smart contracts.

“DeFi platforms function similarly to traditional banks and financial services companies and could pose a disruption risk in the coming years,” Needham’s John Todaro said in a recent report focused on the DeFi opportunity. “In the current yield starved environment, there has been an increased demand for DeFi platforms which offer significantly higher yields than traditional financial products.”

But like cryptocurrency activity broadly, DeFi comes with many different kinds of risks, including regulation, asset volatility and the technology itself. Because there aren’t banks or other third-party companies facilitating transactions, there’s no insurance on funds that could potentially get lost. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, which means assets put up as collateral could quickly decline in value if there’s a downturn, which could lead to positions being liquidated. And there could be errors in the original smart contract code.

The current estimated value of funds locked into DeFi-related contracts is $55.21 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.

Dorsey said the team is committed to building in a transparent way that includes an “open roadmap, open development, and open source.”

Mike Brock, who leads strategic initiatives within Square’s consumer product Cash App, will lead the new business.

“Technology has always been a story of decentralization,” he said in a follow-up tweet. “From the printing press, to the internet to bitcoin – technology has the power to distribute power to the masses and unleash human potential for good, and I’m convinced this is the next step.”",StockMarket,Square is building a decentralized finance business using bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/oltz3v/square_is_building_a_decentralized_finance/,True,submission

Disclosure - I am a big believer in MOOCs and online education and believe this is the future of education. Even though I try to be critical in my research, confirmation bias is a real thing.

**Coursera research and valuation**

**Thesis**

Due to the world experiencing COVID/Coronavirus pandemic starting in 2020, regular life and how we view it changed radically. One of the biggest sectors touched was/is Education - schools and Universities had to shift from in person to fully remote learning. Even though e-learning/EdTech was one of the fastest growing markets, the pandemic forced the adoption of technology faster and changed the education market forever.

There are 2 main factors for the growth of e-learning/Massive Online Open Courses(MOOC) industries:

* **People are looking for a higher pay/change in a career**
* **Universities/Education needs to move online or at least to offer a hybrid model of education**

**People are looking for a higher pay/change in a career**

* Average number of jobs in a lifetime - 12. Average job tenure is 4.3 years for men and 4.0 for women.

* 75% of the workforce says they are planning to go back to education at some point in their life.

* Only 14% of the U.S. workers believe they have the perfect job and more than a half want to change careers. 

**Universities/Education needs to move online or at least to offer a hybrid model of education.**

The value offered by universities and campuses has always been in question - the pandemic pushed universities online and made them recalculate their fees and costs.
&gt; (“The pandemic pushed universities online. The change was long overdue” , Harvard Business Review, September 29, 2020)

Education is one of the least digitized sectors which suggest future technology disruption.
&gt; (“Measuring the Digital Economy”, SCB, May 2019)

**Problems**

* 62% of people identified money as a barrier to gain knowledge/skill to advance or switch their career.

* 60% of people identified time as a barrier to gain knowledge/skill to advance or switch their career.

&gt; (EdX survey, July 10, 2018)



**MOOCs** is an answer to both of these problems - it is not bound to schedule and usually is self paced so a person can do it on their free time while keeping a full time employment and in this way not lose income and it is eliminating campus and staff costs which makes it a lot cheaper.

When it comes to university education, it offers more than just knowledge - it offers networking, campus life experience, a chance for students to leave their parents home and get independent life experience. This is something MOOCs cannot compete with and loses a big chunk of potential customers.

**Market size**

The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) market size is projected to reach $ 67.18 Bn by 2027 from $ 7.34 Bn in 2020 with a CAGR of 37.2% between 2021 - 2027.

2020 has been the 9th year of modern MOOC movement and has crossed 180 million global learners (excluding China). 2020 provided 60 million new learners globally (half of them is just by Coursera). 

**Company overview**

Coursera, Inc. operates an online educational content platform that connects learners, educators, and institutions. It offers online courses that include data science, business, computer science, information technology, health, social sciences, logic, project management, and digital marketing services; campus student plans; degree courses; and certification education. Coursera, Inc. was formerly known as Dkandu, Inc. and changed its name to Coursera, Inc. in April 2012. The company was incorporated in 2011 and is based in Mountain View, California.


**How does it make money?**

Coursera revenue is broken down into 3 segments:

* Consumer - learners paying monthly subscription fee. (59%)
* Entreprise - companies buying packages to provide education to their employees (28%)
* Degree - universities using Coursera platform to provide full remote bachelor and master degrees.(13%)

**Revenue Growth**

**Consumer**
Employers view online degrees/credentials differently - Online credentials are now mainstream, with a solid majority (61%) of HR leaders believing that credentials earned online are of generally equal quality to those completed in-person, up from lower percentages in years past.(“Educational Credentials Come Of Age”, Center of the Future of Higher Education &amp; Talent Strategy, December 2018)
The value of education continues to increase which will drive an interest in people to gain new skills/credentials.

Change in value of education in hiring vs 5 years ago:

* 48% HR says the amount of education required for the same position increased.
* 29% says stayed the same.
* 23% says it declined.

&gt; (“Educational Credentials Come Of Age”, Center of the Future of Higher Education &amp; Talent Strategy, December 2018)


Another growth trend is attracting college dropouts - 33% of students dropout every year. The reasoning varies from financial issues and time constraints to dissatisfaction in education level. Coursera offers addition of credits so students can pick up where they left off and do not need to start from the beginning. This allows attracting not just new students who want to gain credentials in new fields, but people who already started and would like to finish.
&gt; (“College dropout rates &amp; statistics 2021” Admissionsly, 2021)

Coursera total learners 2020-2021 increased by 56%. The challenge will be to keep the growth after the pandemic. Few of the factors it depends on :

* Management experience in the continued growth of online services.
* Reinvestments into growing the content library and keeping it updated with market needs.
* Efficient marketing to target customers.
* Penetration of Rest of the World markets. (51% of all revenue comes from USA alone)

**Enterprise**

Microcredentials and upskilling employees is essential to keep the company competitive - 44% of employers report that they increased the level of education required for the same job roles over the last 5 years. This will force companies to provide education/knowledge updates to their employees to stay competitive in the market.

Another factor is employee retention rate - 2019 LinkedIn Workforce Learning Report showed that 94% of employees would stay longer with the company if they helped them to learn and invested into upskilling. That is a huge factor which will drive the growth of the enterprise education market and Coursera, as a leader of the market, is positioned for the big growth.

The enterprise revenue for Coursera grew by 47% from 2019 to 2020 and it is the second fastest growing revenue after degree service. 

**Degree**

2019 - 2020 Degree segment grew by 97% - this is mainly due to the pandemic - universities were forced to find ways to deliver education to students. Coursera offers online management services for universities, helping institutions to launch online degree programs and share the revenue from tuition. 

The further it goes the more universities will move online - some will create their own platforms, but only 5% college budget spending is dedicated to IT spending (2017 EDUCAUSE Core Data Service Benchmarking Report) and creating the platform needs substantial investments. 
Coursera as a market leader and recognizable name is positioned great in the market.

**Competition**

MOOC is relatively new industry (started in 2011), but already has a few key established players. Top MOOC providers offerings:


**Company**| **Learners** | **Courses** | **Microcredentials** | **Degrees**
:----------|:-------------|:-----------:|:--------------------:|:----------:
**Coursera**    | 76 million   | 4,600       | 610                  | 25
**edX**         | 35 million   | 3,100       | 385                  | 13
**FutureLearn** | 14 million   | 1,160       | 86                   | 28
**Swayam**      | 16 million   | 1,130       | 0                    | 0



&gt; (“By the numbers: MOOCs in 2020”, ClassCentral, Nov 2020)


Coursera is a clear leader in the industry due to their investment in marketing, reach and a superior amount of content available for the users. In 2020 Coursera added more new users than edX since its inception and managed to run away from the pack. 

Most of the for profit MOOCs work on the same principle - monthly subscription (discounts for yearly subscription) with 7 day free trial, to gain an official credential you have to be subscribed. 

**Company**|**Monthly subscription**|**Yearly access
:----------|:----------------------:|:-------------:
**Coursera** |$ 39-79 | $ 399
**edX**    |$ 39 |$ 349
**FutureLearn**|$ 39 |$ 280
**Swayam**|Free|Free


Coursera is the only company who offers different monthly subscriptions depending on the content customer wants to access and that allows them to charge a higher price for yearly unlimited access subscription.


*Swayam offers taking exams in exam centers for a fee.

Please, I'm looking for intelligent, fact-based opinions. I've done my own research, but am hoping to get more opinions from experienced investors/traders with years of stock market experience under their belts.

Examples of what I'm looking for:
Yes, I think AMC will squeeze soon because the short volume is around 20% and shorts have to cover. (My thoughts on a response like this would be: I thought they could just wait it out? Even though it costs them money, they are probably making enough on other plays to make up for that.)

Or no, it won't squeeze because they just reported failure to deliver at 80% less than it was a month ago, so they already covered. (My thoughts on a response like this would be: This already happened in March, too, then the FTD numbers went back up.

&gt;The Producer Price Index for final demand increased 0.8 percent in May, seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Final demand prices rose 0.6 percent in April and 1.0 percent in March. (See table A.) On an unadjusted basis, the final demand index advanced 6.6 percent for the 12 months ended in May, the largest increase since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010.

Some materials are up 40-100% compared to last May and 10-12% compared to last month! The only thing that is seeing a month-on-month decrease is transportation. Services in general are increasing in price less than materials which could mean that there are supply bottlenecks, but it could also be increased demand. Check the breakdown here: [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.t02.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.t02.htm)

I think it’s great what you are doing and i wish you all to become millionaires! I am a student at the University of Zurich and am studying Banking &amp; Finance. 

Now at the moment i am looking for a stock that is at the beginning of a squeeze, so we can get the full percentual increase. I am looking for a stock where we would be one of the first to invest in. We would be before fomo and before the hype. 

A new chapter in the short squeeze history. Look at it and even invest a little. You don’t need to sell amc. Market is always moving. First gme, and the people who were promoting amc were shills, now amc and people are calling us shills. It’s about being faster than the other people, and about diversification.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:

&amp;#x200B;

1.	Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 53% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.

2.	It also has some hype built around it with and is one of the top mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.

3.	On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 29.63B and WKHS is at only 1.74B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar volume that AMC had, it could increase very strong. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.

4.	It is easier to move this stock, because there are less shares and a low market cap. It only needs a little volume and can lift off very high. So the probability for it to squeeze even with a little volume is very high.

5.	It isn’t a dying business. It’s a future orientated stock which can bring an impact to the future. They were considered for the USPS Deal, which shows that they are a good company, besides the losses (Every company in the EV Industry isn’t having profit at the beginning, but they are working on it to increase production because demand is here). This Deal blew off due to suspicious circumstances, and the FBI is currently investigating.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I see good potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now! BUT IT NEEDS VOLUME! Not a lot, but it needs some Volume.

To my understanding what they talk about is shares regarding an ""ESOP"" or Employee Stock Ownership Plan. **\[I tried to understand the S-8 filing but these kind of documents are kinda cryptic to me, in case I didn't see the details or am too dumb to understand, if somebody has the info, feel free to share it in the comments!\]**

Why am I writing this? I have read some big BS regarding this filing like ""Employees will buy tons of shares"" and bla bla...there are many people online at the moment to try and pump anything that looks like news about GEO without having any idea what's behind certain company actions. I am not all-knowing as well, but I try to look behind the curtain and understand what that means. So if you see that I am interpreting something wrong, please correct me. Now there's an S-8 filing...and then what:

* Who gets stock?
* Where do the stocks come from?
* How does this affect shareholders and share price?

The first question is simple, the stocks will be going to employees of the company.

The amount to be registered is 16,800,000 shares. This means that 16,800,000 shares will change hands or will be created. ESOPs are set up as trust funds and can be funded by companies

1. putting newly issued shares into them,
2. putting cash in to buy existing company shares,
3. or borrowing money through the entity to buy company shares.

What does it mean for the shareholders? You get diluted in some way. In case 1, new shares will be issued that dilute the existing values of your shares.

If a company is worth $1bn and has 100,000,000 shares outstanding,one share is $10. Now 10,000,000 shares are issued. New share price is $9.09 ($1bn / 110,000,000 shares). So the shareholders pay the employees $0.91 each. This kinda sucks!

In case 2, the company buys shares from you and gives it to the employees. So you get $10 bucks a share if you sell and the employee gets the share worth $10. In case everybody buys and holds the stock price might go up a little and you get a profit. Since those shares might be subject to a vesting period. So the employees might not be allowed to sell the shares immediately. In this case, I would like that. Because the company uses cash on hands to buy the shares, signalling the company can afford it and expects constant cash flows. Those shares virtually reduce the shares outstanding, since the shares are being bought from the market and held for vesting, making them unavailable for trading, right? Nice move for a heavily shorted company...just mentioning $GME when nobody noticed the huge buyback and the company had &gt;100% short interest.

In case 3, the company would do the same thing as in case 2, but with borrowed money. Since GEO Group wants to de-leverage, I think they use the cash on hands and not taking on more credit to reward employees at shareholders risk. Since the founder of the company is still on board, this is nice to me, because those people are married with their company and don't want to see their life's work fail.

I hope the article makes sense and I have gotten everything right. In case you find a logical error or that I have misunderstood anything, let me know or comment below.

* Weedmaps is a two-sided and double coined cannabis e-commerce tech company
* enjoys a potential first mover advantage
* has a lot of momentum going for both the company and the stock. its expansion efforts ride in tandem with the ever-advancing legalization efforts of cannabis in the US and abroad. 
* Strong brand recognition
* Lofty expansion numbers, yet they seem very obtainable given certain metrics and catalysts involved. 
* While Listed publically as a SPAC ($SSPK), Weedmaps flew considerably under the radar, but it still represents a deep value stock pick, one that is a safer picks and shovels play against the often riskier and unpredictable marijuana growers stocks.
* Credible pressures and competition could weigh on Weedmaps’ expansion efforts, but the company has been a profitable business since its inception in 2008, and stands to enjoy a head start in that regard in terms of navigating and capitalizing from newly allowed markets or potential outright legalization. 

**PERSONAL DISCLOSURES:**  
This isn’t financial advice or persuasion. All data provided is presented for informational and educational purposes only. But if you like the stock, hey, you like the stock. 

I own 470 shares outright, with an average cost basis of around $19.50 since forever. I use Weedmaps every so often. I have had friends and acquaintances that currently use Weedmaps for their business, or have had in the past. Weedmaps has not sponsored or endorsed this report in any fashion.

Folks, here we have a newly de-spacked and officially listed cannabis tech play; among the first of its kind to hit any of the major stock exchanges. MAPS (formerly the SPAC $SSPK), was introduced to public trading today by way of the NASDAQ – and stands for Weedmaps, which if you don’t already know is the world’s leading software-as-a-service (SAAS) platform catering specifically to the cannabis and marijuana industry. 

**BEST OF BOTH WORLDS**: Weedmaps is at heart an e-commerce technology company, and its stock will be classified as such. However, its a tech company that has been deeply embedded into the cannabis industry and culture since its inception in 2008.

It’s is the name after all. Some would argue that being listed this way, as a technology company, alleviates some the more intrinsic perceived risks of other cannabis and marijuana stocks, particularly growers and handlers of the plant. While Weedmaps has a long history with the plant, it never touches it.  

“Founded in 2008, WMH operates Weedmaps, the leading online listings marketplace for cannabis consumers and businesses, and WM Business, the most comprehensive SaaS subscription offering sold to cannabis retailers and brands. The Company solely provides software and other technology solutions and is non-plant touching. **WMH has grown revenue at a CAGR of 40% over the last five years and is on track to deliver $160 million in revenue and $35 million in EBITDA for 2020.”**

**The cannabis industry is a multibillion-dollar business that's poised to grow rapidly as new markets open and more states legalize both medical and adult-use programs.**

* Nationwide sales increased 67% in 2020 – this is in part due to the pandemic.
* The U.S. cannabis industry is now projected to be worth $100 billion USD by 2030. For reference, in 2019, Wall Street’s top cannabis analyst, Cowen Vivien Azer, predicted it'd be $80 billion by 2030.
*  The expected annual growth rate of the cannabis market from 2019 to 2021 is 21%. Therefore, in three years, the marijuana industry will be making an annual revenue of $23 billion

[https://mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-firm-weedmaps-aims-for-175-percent-revenue-growth/](https://mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-firm-weedmaps-aims-for-175-percent-revenue-growth/)

WeedMaps, which began in 2008, has already built a moat by penetrating \~90% of the very fragmented California market (which accounts for 50% of its revenues), and with the cannabis market in the US projected to double over the next five years, it should continue to scale rapidly. 

It’s not only revenue generating but also profit generating. The business grew its revenues at a 40% CAGR over the last five years and is projected to do $165M in sales this year and $35M in EBITDA. **Weedmaps’ growth story is predicated on increasing their pricing and the number of paying clients. They project a 23% revenue growth in 2021 followed by 40% each in 2022 and 2023.** 

Weedmaps has reported seeing the average dollar-value of purchases made through its platform double on pickup orders and increase 37 percent on deliveries at the start of the pandemic, but many analysts expect online ordering and delivery to remain as a newfound cornerstone of the pot industry.

*Key Drivers of FY21-23 Projected Growth*  
 These projections do not rely on significant new market openings, but could experience potential upside as a result. 

Revenue

* Continued capture of new license issuance within existing markets
* Growth in average per client in-line with historical retention and expansion trends with acceleration from new pricing models
* No new US states assumed in FY21-22
* FY21 growth reflects reset of Canada

Gross Margin

* Increased server utilization from Data initiatives
* Expansion of WM Retail
* Expansion of performance based ads
* Results in margin pressure

EBITDA

* Accelerated investments in sales and marketing
* Product development OPEX growth in-line with the rate of revenue growth
* G&amp;A leverage over time

In September 2020, Weedmaps had 4,171 clients paying $3,678 per month each, which annualizes to a run rate of $185 million. To grow revenue 28% in 2021 and 40% each in 2022 and 2023, the company will need to increase the number of clients and/or increase the revenue from each client. Weedmaps says it plans to do both.

Weedmaps said it would raise the price on its base monthly subscription prices by 18% for retailers (to $495 from $420) and 34% for delivery clients (to $395 from $295) as of Jan. 1. However, this translates to revenue growth of only 2%-3%, so there’s a lot more work to be done. The bulk – 76% – of Weedmaps’ revenue comes from its featured listings. Like Google’s business model, featured listings let retailers and brands pay more to have their listings highlighted and competitively bid up for traffic. Weedmaps believes these listings, with an average cost per click of 50 cents per listing, are underpriced compared to their value, so the company is shifting to “performance-based” pricing.

Weedmaps’ value proposition for clients is highly dependent on both the geography and level of competition among retailers in that area. Once enough retailers are using Weedmaps, the rest will need to join to maintain their market share. Reflecting this dynamic, Weedmaps has penetrated 80%-100% of the fragmented California market (which accounts for 50% of the company’s revenue) but less than 50% of the rest of the U.S. Small, single-unit operators without their own brand or scale receive the biggest benefit from advertising on Weedmaps. Weedmaps has penetrated about a quarter of the retailers controlled by the larger publicly traded multistate operators, which typically operate in more limited-license states and have the resources to invest in their own loyalty programs, brands and traffic drivers. In between these two categories are the large single-state operators, which, on average, list about half their stores on Weedmaps. Their stores that are listed on the platform typically are located in tourist destinations with transient customers who might be unfamiliar with the local brand.

Weedmaps remains well poised to eventually be able to take a larger cut of the overall marijuana pie. At some point in the future, Weedmaps can and most likely will engage in taking a cut of GMV. This can turn out to be quite a value proposition; if they can charge a certain percentage take rate, Weedmaps can potentially bring in hundreds of millions in additional revenue over the course of just a few years. Many dispensaries have high margins, so Weedmaps potential take rate could even exist in the double digit percentages in the not too distant future. This can affect their net margins and bring in extra income per share alone.

**MAIN COMPETITORS**

**Public Companies**

Currently Weedmaps has first mover advantage, as there are no publicly listed companies on any major stock exchange acting as a software service company catering specifically to the cannabis retail sector. This is subject to change in the future, as more states legalize marijuana, and as full scale federal legalization becomes a reality. In light of these future potentials, Weedmaps can still enjoy some time being the only of its class.

Indirect, but viable competitors can and do still exist, however. These are the Amazons, the Ubers, and the Googles of the world, as major tech companies such as these have resource and brand advantages to utilize if they so wish to enter and participate in the cannabis sector. Time and other factors will tell if that becomes a reality, but as of now, no major tech company has expressed any outright serious notions of entering the space.

**Private Companies**  
 The story is different with privately operated companies, to which there are many in the field. Namely, if you aren’t counting Weedmaps, there are The Big Three:

* Dutchie
* Jane
* Leafly

Many will state Leafly is Weedmaps’ biggest competitor, but really there’s many davids to Weedmaps’ goliath. Companies such as Dutchie. Leafly, Jane, Leaflink and Eaze all pose credible market share threats to Weedmaps, especially in a newly legalized landscape.

**BEAR CASE**

* **Too much concentration in certain key demographics and regions.** Such as California, where 52.4% of WeedMap’s revenue came in 2020.
* **Weedmaps forward expansion is too reliant on wide scale legalization in the US, on both the state and federal levels.** Any setbacks or legislative blocks can hamper some of Weedmaps growth prospects in the coming years
* **Persistent competition in a rapidly saturated industry could affect Weedmaps pricing models and market share, among other aspects of their overall expansion goals.** Either by way of customers being pulled away to other similar platforms, or by needing to go head to head with major tech players such as Uber, DoorDash, etc if legalization becomes a reality.
* **Weedmaps software and development is in need of a revamp, especially when pitted against its emerging competitors, such as Dutchie.** A major concern that many business clients have with the Weedmaps platform is that it lacks behind its competitors in mass POS integration. It is also evident that the API tools offered are not as robust and streamlined as they could be. Finally, the consumer facing Weedmaps interface (the .com and the mobile app) could use improvements; small tweaks in terms of navigation, accessibility, responsiveness and external web linking could be improved. 

**TO CONCLUDE:** while Weedmaps definitely has hurdles to jump through regarding its expansion efforts, that lie particularly at the crossroads of emerging competition and reliance on legalization efforts, it enjoys still a hefty market share of the up and coming cannabis e-commerce industry. As the industry grows, so too will external competitive and economic difficulties, but Weedmaps seems very well positioned to fulfill and continue its high growth expectations in light of it. They have already in business for over a decade, so to a degree they have a certain headstart on building a profitable business in the tough to navigate cannabis industry. If they have pulled off being profitable for over a decade in a non-legalized country, imagine what they can do when it is legalized (or at least that seems to be a mantra of their own) Yet, in addition to their tenured time in the cannabis world, they are still first to the stock market as far as cannabis specific tech companies are concerned.

Weedmaps enjoys advantages such as market share, strong brand recognition, first mover advantage, and a long history of being a profitable company. It is well equipped to capitalize on the quickly expanding online ordering and delivery aspects to the industry as well. It is for this reason Weedmaps is a fantastic growth opportunity, one that can potentially reward long term investors for many years to come.",StockMarket,MAPS – WM Technologies (Weedmaps) A freshly squeezed DD,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o162lm/maps_wm_technologies_weedmaps_a_freshly_squeezed/,True,submission

Every investor knows that the path toward profits lies in buying low and selling high. That’s a basic precept of any economic trading system. The trick, however, is recognizing when the stock is low enough to buy in. The prime moment to buy is when the stock hits bottom; that will maximize returns when the share price starts to rise again.

Wall Street’s analyst corps know this, and they are not shying away from recommending stocks that may have hit bottom. Using [TipRanks database](http://www.tipranks.com/?ref=blog), we pinpointed two such stocks. Each is down significantly, but each also has enough upside potential to warrant a Buy rating.

**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** **(**[**VRTX**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vrtx/forecast)**)**

We’ll start with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm that got its start back in 1989, researching treatments for cystic fibrosis. The company now has four approved drugs on the market for the treatment of CF, and is expected to dominate this particular segment for the next two decades. Nevertheless, the stock has been falling this year, and is down 20% year-to-date.

The most recent sell-off came this past Friday, June 11, and coincided with the company's decision to end its clinical trial program for VX-864, a drug candidate under investigation as a treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD). The decision was made after the drug failed to show clear clinical benefits in its Phase 2 trial.

Biotech research programs fail frequently – it is a baked-in risk of the business. Of greater concern to investors than this individual program is the larger fact that over the years Vertex has yet to develop a successful drug program outside of its line of CF treatments. Concern that the company may be a one-trick pony underlay the recent sell-off.

Within the CF program, however, Vertex has had considerable success. The company’s four approved drugs (trade names Trikafta, Symdeko, Orkambi, and Kalydeco) are proven money-makers in an established market, and the company has seen revenues increase sequentially in the last 6 quarters. The most recent quarter, 1Q21, showed $1.72 billion at the top line, up 14% year-over-year. GAAP EPS, at $2.49, was up 8.7% yoy.

Writing on Vertex in the wake of the VX-864 discontinuation, Cowen analyst [Phil Nadeau](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/phil-nadeau) acknowledges the failure of the program – but also the company’s fundamental strength.

“While '864's demise is disappointing, in some ways it is a 'good failure' that advances the program and partially de-risks safety and the mechanism. Vertex has a track record of iterating in its pipeline, producing increasingly better candidates. We are optimistic that Vertex will eventually produce a successful AAT corrector that increases fAAT levels above the protective threshold, with benign safety... We think Vertex is positioned for L-T outperformance as CF franchise revenue grows at a 9% CAGR and pipeline candidates advance,” Nadeau opined.

Nadeau sees Vertex in the process of ‘failing up,’ and rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy). His $300 price target implies an upside of 59% on the one-year time frame. (To watch Nadeau’s track record, [**click here**](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/phil-nadeau))

A look at the analyst consensus shows that Nadeau is hardly an outlier on this stock. Of the 24 recent reviews, 19 are to Buy and only 5 are to Hold, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. The shares are priced at $188.97 and the $261.68 average price target suggests a 38% one-year upside. ([See VRTX stock analysis on TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vrtx/forecast))

**OneConnect Financial Technology (**[**OCFT**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ocft/forecast)**)**

Now let’s change gears, and move from biotech to software tech. OneConnect is a fintech, operating in China’s digital banking sector. This puts the company solidly in the middle of a huge potential growth market; digital banking was expanding before corona, but the pandemic year saw online banking services expand. The digital banking market is estimated at $8 trillion globally – and China, with the world’s largest population and second largest economy, is positioned to make outsize gains in the area. This is the environment in which OneConnect lives.

The company offers technology-as-a-service, putting a range of digital banking tools and applications on one platform. This makes OneConnect a one-stop-shop for digital banking providers, and the company serves almost all of China’s major and city banks, and more than half of the country’s insurance companies.

OneConnect has, like many expanding tech companies, been running consistent net losses. The company has yet to turn a profit – although the 1Q21 EPS loss of 13 cents was an improvement over the year-ago loss of 17 cents per share. At the top line, Q1 revenues came in at $126.5 million (820 million Chinese yuan), up 52% year-over-year.

Even with that, however, the stock dropped sharply this year, losing 39% of its value. Yet, at least one analyst sees the current low share price as a chance to buy in.

HSBC analyst [Carson Lo](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/carson-lo) gives OCFT a Buy rating, and sets a $20 price target that indicates room for \~66% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Lo’s track record, [**click here**](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/carson-lo))

“The recovery in the business activities has driven revenue from third-party customers, helping to maintain the accelerating yoy growth trajectory, and we expect this trend to remain in the coming quarters, on: 1) delivery of sizable contracts secured in 1Q... and 2) easy comparables ahead in 2H21 as the company has ramped up its product-optimisation efforts, i.e. exiting the low-margin legacy products (mainly in the business origination segment), since mid-2020,” Lo wrote.

Overall, while there are only two recent reviews on file for OneConnect, both agree that this stock is one to buy, making the Moderate Buy consensus unanimous. The share price, of $12.07, and the average price target of $22, together suggest a one-year upside potential of 82%.

Couple of weeks ago ticker:BEST offered potential breakout from an oversold level in a downtrend, BUY signal was triggered at 1.27, and I got in as usual. Now the price is 1.60, the trade is up already 25%. Looking to sell the oversold soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Reversals offer opportunities for huge gains, but it's crucial to buy them when the ""BUY"" signal is triggered (i.e. when it leaves the oversold area) otherwise you risk to try to catch a falling knife.

This week I see a lot of potential in ticker:BLL (Ball corporation), however the Buy signal is not yet triggered. This is in my watchlist until it's time to buy.

TLDR;

Low Float= 8 million shares available 
All of you retards would be fighting for even just one share. 

Mkt Cap is 1.74 Billion

This company has great fundamentals, great company outlook, and its annual revenue continuously increases YoY sitting at 553 million for FY20.

Options are cheap sitting at 5 and 10 dollars a contract.  – IV is only 84%



Low Volume is a whopping 230k average daily. 

This can’t go tits up with SOLID MOVEMENT. 

I was inspired by a Vizio post that blew WIDE FUCKING OPEN

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzyg3y/vzio_tendies_in_4k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

# I: Fundamentals

We know you guys are all fucking retarded, but if your wife’s boyfriend wanted you to pick a play this sir is the one that can’t go tits up. 

•blew earning out this quarter, and continued growth. 
•this stock is only going up
•held heavily by institutions because of potential. 

# II. Catalysts

•shareholders meeting 06/21 


# III: Technicals

Here’s why I think SCWX is the next VZIO

EXTREMELY LOW FLOAT. The float on this is around 8 million shares, which is even half of VZIO. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio’s float is only 4% of AMC’s and less than half of GME’s. If you’re still confused let me say it this way EVERYONE HERE would have to FIGHT for even 1 share. 

**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is sitting around 200k daily. 

**Options are cheap:** it is literally .05 for the next strike price. 

# IV: Conclusion

This is clearly a winner even with movement. This stock will soar and you’ll cry because you missed it too. I’ve been a long time lurker and this right here is the wave that you don’t want to miss at all. The company will clearly continue to grow so buying shares will not leave you that big of a bag holder. This is also a nice long term hold. 

Don’t be a fucking degenerate and get your one lucky share. There was only 8 million and to be quite frank I just bought 50c 6/18 22.5 strike, and 87 shares because I’m a broke bitch and that’s all I can afford. 

Movement alone will bring the tendies to our hands.

 **PUBLISHED WED, JUN 16 20216:51 AM EDT**

[**Ernestine Siu**](https://www.cnbc.com/ernestine-siu/)[**@IN/ERNESTINESIU/**](https://linkedin.com/in/ernestinesiu/)[**@ERNESTINESIU**](https://twitter.com/ErnestineSiu) 

**In this article**

* [**TSLA-1.21** **(-0.20%)**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA)
* Shares of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA) closed lower despite a strong call from Mizuho.

Analysts at the firm reiterated their buy rating on the stock, citing the company’s leadership in the global electric vehicle market and expecting the stock to get a boost from the Biden administration’s proposed infrastructure plan. 

Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, told CNBC on Tuesday that Tesla’s roughly 24% market share and ambitions in the electric vehicle, space and clean energy markets make it a name worth watching.

“Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in the industry, especially for the foreseeable future,” Bapis said on[ “Trading Nation.”](https://www.cnbc.com/trading-nation/) “When you think Tesla, you think innovation.”

He expects the company to keep delivering strong sales and earnings growth, which he said could raise demand for the stock.

“If you look at some of these institutional funds ... and they don’t have this stock in there, they’re definitely going to get questioned why,” he said.

Although Tesla did run up “too far, too fast” last year as people piled into the stock, Bapis said now is a great time to buy the dip.

“Unless someone comes in and breaks through the difficult barriers to entry, you’re going to see this stock grow long term,” he said. “Any time you get the chance to buy it, buy it.”

He added that although its supply chain has been riddled with delays and shortages, Tesla was a strong long-term buy considering its fundamentals and growth potential. 

“I think it’s the time to buy it right now and just put it away,” he said. “Close your eyes on the volatility for a little bit and bet on the fundamentals and the leadership of the company. I mean, you can’t get a better leader than they have.”

In the same “Trading Nation” interview, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that Tesla’s stock has been relatively flat for the past several months, trading around its 200-day moving average.

&amp;#x200B;

[TESLA \(TSLA\)](https://preview.redd.it/izl2fysd4n571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31b3a45add9d857fc1170cf3f10452d15f46d0b6)

“You don’t see that very often,” he said. “Whichever way it breaks away from that 200-day moving average will give us a little bit of a hint \[about\] its next move.”

The stock is also forming a descending triangle pattern, Maley said, saying the upper end of the pattern is around $650 and the lower end sits at $563. Those are the two levels to watch, and where shares move relative to those levels will be very indicative of where Tesla is headed, he said.

“In the past, when the stock has been stuck in this sideways range, once it breaks out, it starts to move in a big way. This should be no different,” he said.

Tesla’s deliveries report in the first week of July could be a breakout catalyst, Maley said.

**Important:**

This information is all off of its most recent quarterly report on March 12th. Therefore, this analysis is based on the most current public data on the company. I pulled all of it from Capital IQ (the gold standard that professional analysts use to acquire accurate and up to date information on xyz companies)

**Fundamentals** (at a glance): 

1. **CASH:** **$1774 million.** WISH is flush with cash. Of its 1.9b in current assets, 1.77b of that is cash and equivalents. This coupled with low debt means the opportunities to invest in growth opportunities or issue dividends are expansive.
2. **DEBT: $49 million.** WISH has virtually no debt. It could easily pay it off right now if it wanted to. This is massive for investors because it means that once its few debt holders are paid off, all excess earnings will be distributed to equity holders aka you and me. This will happen either in the form of investing in projects that will grow revenues and thus increase the value of the operating assets or in the form of dividends. You can see how these industry leading debt figures massively increase equity value in the model in the previous valuation model image post.
3. **Revenue Growth: 28.85%**

**Revenue (billions)**

2017 Rev: 1.101

2018 Rev: 1.728

2019 Rev: 1.901

2020 Rev: 2.541

2021 Rev: 3.274 (Cap IQ estimate)

This estimate indicates an expected growth in revenue of 28.85%. You could easily make an argument for this estimate being extremely conservative based on a multitude of factors (I’ll go into these in part 3 of the DD).

However, even if adopting the 28.85% growth estimate into your model, these 3 operating statistics show an incredibly financially healthy company, which is criminally undervalued. Based on these current operating statistics the true implied intrinsic value across multiples is on average **28.56 per share**, which is roughly **300%** from where the stock is trading now. You can see the calculation used to get to this below, but also note the high estimate of this information is **69.6 per share,** which indicates an almost **700%** from the current price**.** That is what it should be priced at TODAY based on the company’s current state and future prospects. Please reference the Cap IQ valuation model in the previous image post to see how these operating stats work together to create these pricing estimates.

I will release part 2 of the DD later which will focus on comparative analysis using multiples to calculate the price of the stock based on market supply and demand (I’ll also explain what this means).",StockMarket,WISH DD Using Capital IQ (Part 1 of 3)- What True Fundamentals say About the Real Value of WISH,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o174z4/wish_dd_using_capital_iq_part_1_of_3_what_true/,True,submission

By Costas Paris,   June 8, 2021 3:04 pm ET 

Global shipyards that were retrenching and consolidating in a faltering maritime market barely more than a year ago are now flush with new orders, boosted by efforts by shipping lines to add capacity to meet resurgent consumer demand in Western economies.

Orders for new container ships in the first five months of this year were nearly double the orders for all of both 2019 and 2020, according to London-based maritime data provider VesselsValue Ltd., with the biggest gains going to shipyards in South Korea and China.

The order tally has been so strong that some yards have stopped giving quotes for new vessels and are trying to renegotiate existing orders for more than 20 ships as the price of steel plates used to build vessels has doubled since the end of 2020, according to people involved in those deals.

The resurgence in ordering is being driven mainly by container ships as Western retailers such as [Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WMT) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. scramble to restock after a year of supply-chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic.

The rush to replenish depleted inventories, along with congestion at major ports in North America, Europe and Asia, has left cargo space hard to find and sent freight rates soaring. That has [spurred big profit gains](https://www.wsj.com/articles/maersk-posts-record-profit-steps-up-buyback-program-11620231653?mod=article_inline) at operators like [A.P. Moller-Maersk](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMKBY) A/S, CMA CGM SA and [Hapag-Lloyd](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/HLAG) AG , as well as triggered moves to renew and expand their fleets.

“They are making bucketloads of money and when that happens, owners invest in new ships,” said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Denmark-based shipping trade body Bimco. “Orders have doubled so far in 2021, nearly reaching the total tonnage ordered for all of last year. I won’t be surprised if there is another wave of ordering.”

The strong orders are in contrast with the past couple of years, when a long downturn in maritime trade left a dwindling backlog of orders at shipyards and [forced some to consolidate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/merger-of-yards-in-south-korea-china-will-control-global-shipbuilding-11564653601?mod=article_inline).

Data from London-based shipping broker Braemar ACM Shipbroking show that in the first five months of this year, ships totaling capacity for about 2.6 million containers—measured in 20-foot equivalent units, a standard maritime measure—are on order, putting the business on track to surpass an annual record of 2.8 million containers’ worth of capacity ordered in all of 2007.

“It’s been our busiest period in years and it’s very much about container ships,” said a senior executive of South Korea’s [Hyundai Heavy Industries](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR/XKRX/009540) Co. , the world’s biggest shipbuilding facility in terms of capacity. “The orders are mostly for bigger ships with all the extras to emit less, which is good for margins. We are almost out of slots to build new ships until late 2023.”

“I’ve never seen such demand in 20 years,” this executive said. South Korea’s three big yards—Hyundai Heavy, [Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR/XKRX/042660) Co. and [Samsung Heavy Industries](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR/XKRX/010140) Co. —account for more than a third of all shipbuilding orders for all types of vessels. The other shipyards with big shares of global orders are China State Shipbuilding Corp., China Shipbuilding Industry Corp. and Japan’s Imabari Shipbuilding Co.

In the first five months of this year, 208 container ships worth $16.3 billion were added to the global order book, compared with 120 ships valued at $8.8 billion for all of last year and 114 vessels worth $6.9 billion in 2019, according to Vessels Value.

The South Korean shipyard executive said the box ship orders are mainly for vessels that can move around 14,500 containers and behemoths with a capacity of more than 20,000 boxes that are mainly deployed on Asia-Europe trade lanes.

An executive at one of China’s big state shipbuilders said owners of roughly two dozen ships are being asked to pay more if they want their vessels delivered because of rising steel prices.

“If the yards adhere to the original contract, they will be delivering the ships at a loss,” said this executive. “A big cargo ship needs around 25,000 to 30,000 tons of steel and that’s an additional $15 million on average from last year in terms of cost. There are at least 22 ships on order that are being renegotiated at big Asian yards.”

Steel can account for up to 30% of a vessel’s cost, depending on the type of ship. Tankers and dry-bulk movers need more steel than container ships. A very large crude carrier now costs around $100 million, up from $85 million last October.",StockMarket,Ship Building Reflections..........,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/o18rvo/ship_building_reflections/,True,submission

* At the time of writing this, **$CRTX** is the 23rd highest short interest stock at 24.79%
* The stock currently trades at $47.72 with a 52 week high of $58.99 (Firesale!!!)
* Compared to other meme stocks, **$CRTX** has extremely low float (meaning it is subject to much more volatile swings and has a much higher likelihood of massive upswings with high volume. **$CRTX= 14.35m float.** Contrast this with WKHS (113.38m) CLOV (112.78M), NKLA (171.77M), BBBY (103.40M)
* **Catalysts-** As this is a relatively newly traded company, there are many potential upcoming catalysts such as

1. clinical trial reports, (**$CRTX** is currently in phase 2/3)
2. Business wire (a Berkshire Hathaway company) recently wrote a report stating: Cortexyme is **advancing a pivotal trial** in Alzheimer’s disease **with topline data expected in the fourth quarter of 2021** and a **growing pipeline** of therapeutics for degenerative diseases.
3. WSB can help this sucker to moon baby, which will 1, make any investor who makes money on the stock richer, and 2, help support a company that is doing GREAT things for the world. I pray there will be companies that kick Alzheimer's butt before all of us apes get old and putting money in them is totally a justifiable and noble idea to support.

If that doesn't get your peter wet, to top it all off, CRTX's analyst predictions are **WAY HIGHER** than the current price target, I'm talking way higher. currently, the stock has been trading throughout the day from roughly $47-$49. The **average analyst price target is $71.29.** the **HIGH price target** is **$190**. Who is to say legitimately how high this can go? This is not financial advice, I am merely looking to bring the bullish news to you all but if ""smart"" analysts could see $190, as a mere WSB contributor, my shot in the dark of a guess could see it hitting much higher than that if retail traders begin to invest in it.

This is the first cannabis-tech company of this caliber to be publicly listed. They don’t have to go OTC like other US cannabis stocks since they don’t “touch the plant”.

What they do:

WeedMaps provides enterprise software to cannabis businesses, running their point of sale (POS) services as well as aiding with logistics, regulatory compliance, wholesaling, and ordering. Clients (dispensaries) pay a monthly fee in a standard SaaS model, with fees for other optional services like featured posts or listing priority on the WeedMaps Marketplace. 

The company has been operating since 2008 and has been consistently profitable from the start. Weedmaps delivered approx $160 million in revenue in 2020 and has been profitable for its entire 12-year history. 

They have 18k+ dispensaries listed on WM Marketplace and over $1.5B GMV (Gross merchandise value) across the WM Business-in-a-Box platform. WeedMaps operates a high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”. 

WeedMaps is an essential service for the operation of many retail dispensaries across the US and the many other countries. (including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland).

For instance, one dispensary chain owner said: “I remember when they (WeedMaps) raised their rates by 400% one year and we took a month off of our listings in protest. Our new client acquisition went down by 35%. Our monthly revenue went down by over $50,000 per location. Lesson learned.” 

Another owner said: “WeedMaps costs us a fortune, but it is worth every penny. They hit us over the head to be listed on the daily deals page, but that shit flies off the shelf.” 🚀🚀

Financials📊

- Revenue forecast to grow at an annualized 40%, EBITDA at an annualized 55% through 2023
- 2020 EBITDA was $43 million
- WeedMaps generates 1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume alone
- Stock trades at enterprise value of ≈5x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps

WeedMaps operates a cloud-based platform, and unlike other cannabis-related businesses, they require minimal physical footprint and are not directly exposed to fluctuations in product input costs. WeedMaps does not require real estate or other significant capital outlays to enter new markets. Their offerings can be customized to new markets to help facilitate expansion, which provides significant flexibility to scale and enter new markets with minimal investment. The capital-efficiency of the WeedMaps business model is evidenced by their robust margin profile and high level of EBITDA converting to free cash flow while achieving their growth. From 2014 to 2020, WM grew revenue at a CAGR of 35%. Over that period of time, WeedMaps has expanded their gross margin rate from 92% to 95%. For 2020, their net income was $39 million and EBITDA was $43 million.

Keep in mind. These financials are still without many states who are bound to legalize or have just recently legalized (NY most notably). As the US cannabis market continues to expand at an exponential rate, WeedMaps will undoubtedly capitalize.

Management: CEO Chris Beals is an absolute Chad and knows how to regulate a complex cannabis industry with his UPenn law degree and weed expertise. Across the WeedMaps executive team, you have high level experience from Goldman Sachs, InstaCart, Google, Snap Inc, Twitter, Nike, Adobe, among other big time corporations. 

Yes, there is tons of regulatory complexities in this industry. But, as an well experienced company (doing business profitably since ‘08) and with possibly more connections than anyone in the cannabis game, WeedMaps looks poised for huge growth in a ‘budding’ industry.

Would love some more advice but here’s my current diversification. Let me know what I can do to change it for the better. So far it’s been doing really well I think, I also sold a couple times at highs and lows but I started here:

Tesla has just recently became even slightly profitable (not even 1 billion dollars), and nio will soon be as well. Is there a reason for this?

As the price failed to hold above key support at $4.50, a breakdown has occurred. This breakdown led to extended losses to $4.30, where the dip was capped. 

Since then the price has been trying to break above key resistance at $4.50, but so far unsuccessfully.

The break above $4.50 is necessary in order to bring the short term uptrend. The break of $4.50 also represents the break above the 50 EMA. 

Dip at $4.30 has created a new lower high, positive sign.

But as the tests of $4.50 were unsuccessful we look for a retest of the trend of lower highs, a dip which has to be bought in order to break the $4.50 resistance.

Current resistance is at $4.50, while support is at $4.30.

Below is a letter they had issued to their investors, as per the website 'Seeking Alpha'. 

\*\*We took a small short position in GME (167 USD). We will continuously hedge the position to avoid being forced out at an inconvenient moment for an inappropriate reason.

The risk is that the market continues to value GME more like art, as to say there is no direct link to the capacity of generating earnings. It could be a symbol for the art of betting against the suits (that’s how many of these social media participants call Wallstreet’s elite). GME stands for the social media provoked short squeeze, like Kleenex for tissues, Zamboni for ice resurfacer, or Jakuzzi for a bubble bath. Any important influencers can restart the currently weakened spread of the narrative. Knowing this, other market participants might bet on exactly this occurrence and by their actions, increase the probability of it.

However, I believe that time runs against them. The spread of the narrative tends to weaken over time. There will be new exciting subjects in our fast-moving world.

The whole trade is based on masses trying to destabilize the offer and demand of the shares. There is no double cushion as to say that the holder benefits at one point from an intrinsic value in the form of dividends or liquidation (the trust of being able to perform both is often sufficient). This makes the trade very fragile during stressful market conditions.

We should not forget that GME is still a retail company that faces declining revenues due to the online streaming competition, a company that has been looking for a buyer for years. Of course, the 550 million USD that the company managed to raise will influence its odds, but does this justify a 10-billion USD difference outcome? Also to be noted is that the company lost several key people.

Many market participants have been caught on the wrong side of this trade. They will anticipate that this can happen again and take precautions. So, several significant hedge funds do not publish their short book on social media anymore to avoid becoming a target. Option sellers will increase the price of the concerned call options to make the trade less attractive.\*\*",StockMarket,More shorting on Gamestop at 167$ by Glacier Capital!!

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips 
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

* 3D printing is currently growing at a CAGR of 24%
* DDD sits at the top of this with its additive manufacturing focus
* DDD specializes in medical and infrastructure spaces. The health care segment is up 39% year over year and this growth is meant to continue at a double-digit clip.
* DDD’s infrastructure segment will most likely benefit from the Biden infrastructure bill
* DDD recently higher a new CEO with a focus on driving growth
* DDD is divesting from some of its non-core segments which make it appear as if the company is slowing its growth.
* It looks like DDD has only grown at 8% this year however if you remove the non-core assets the business is growing at an 18% clip
* Ark holds DDD in its 3D printing Etf as its 3rd largest position

DDD sits at the intersection of reimagining health care devices, infrastructure manufacturing, and the future of the space industry. The company’s new leadership team is focused on the growth of the business and investing heavily in the future. The stock has been sold off recently and maintains a leadership position in an industry growing at 24%. Does anyone have any thoughts on this company?

I've started investing a year ago and have had some near opportunities to change my family's life. I had some safe picks, but also bought GME when it was 5 dollars and doge when it was .004. I sold both with a small profit, but seeing how they skyrocketed has me just so angry at myself. I could have changed my family's fortunes and not live with the day to day stress of bills coming in all the time. I've been holding onto stocks that have really been hit hard since Feb. because I don't want to make the mistake of selling again.- but now am dealing with the stress of seeing red every day while the overall market is green. I think I am building better tolerance for the volatility of the market, but when I have moments along, I just want to cry that I messed up so bad and could have done something amazing. How do you all deal with it? Would appreciate your thoughts. Sorry for the depressing post - this is hard for me to write.

You went to the barbershop and that nice-beard-twisted-mustache-scissors-handling guy told you he just made 200% on his first buy only 2 days after opening his robinhood account.

You went to get a nail polish and that yellow curled hair lady told you she’s gonna quit because of her 500% profit in the pink sheets market.

You got a call from your best friend who told you he is going to live in Spain for the rest of his life because he started trading last March and his account is booming today.

So you’re mad now, looking in the mirror and telling yourself you can’t be the last sucker on Earth. And you gathered your lifetime savings, went to your family and asked for a few more thousand and there you are! The greatest investor of all time. The Buffett of your block. The Munger in that neighborhood.

Aaand you bought your first stocks... Things weren’t bad until you just heard about that GME mania and you said to yourself: “this is it, I’m gonna be a millionaire!”. 2 months later, you are 85% down.

On the way to psychology rejuvenation, you open reddit, youtube, google and start reading books for meditation and mindfulness. It’s ok they all prey, you’re gonna be fine, just don’t sell your losing stocks! You lose money if you close your position they say. Relax, don’t open your trading account and you’re going to be fine. It’s fine - they keep telling you - it is only a matter of time. The stock market is having some bad days but bright days are ahead! Shut off all your distractions and HODL, other headlines say. Your stocks will get you a millionaire but it is jus a matter of time. The company you invested in, is gonna discover the cure for cancer. Time travel machine. Teleportation. Is building a computer software that is able to change the rotation of the Earth. You will just have to wait for 1 or 2 years... and your shitty stock will get from under penny to hundreds bucks per share. 

BULLSHIT !

Sell your f...g loosing positions ASAP! Exit NOW! Throw awat that garbage. More than 10% loss and that falling knife isn’t showing signs of turning around? Sell that bitch! Sell it now! Forget about that misery!

Stop thinking DCA! This strategy works only in certain circumstances. Stop HODLing like a stupid 🦍 and get some real shit in that brain and that account! Put some value stocks on their way up in both.

**1. Understanding the career risk professional investors face can help individual investors:** professional investors often become forced sellers due to liquidity concerns, stop-losses, or bumping up against their portfolio’s risk budget. During market uncertainty, career risk hedging (i.e., not losing clients) can drive professional investors’ actions more than fundamental and/or technical analysis.

**2. Your beliefs of how the stock market** ***should*** **behave are irrelevant:** staying out of the market based on a belief that it is acting irrationally does not give an investor an edge.

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?
&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
&gt; “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
&gt; “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
&gt; “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
&gt; “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
&gt; “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; # Economic rebound
&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
&gt; # Watching bonds
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
&gt; “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

&gt; “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

&gt; Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story

&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

And because of the inflation it went up again between 1945 - 1948.

&amp;#x200B;

It is based on a research journal  [Selected Commodity Prices before and after the Second World War | Download Scientific Diagram (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Selected-Commodity-Prices-before-and-after-the-Second-World-War_fig10_207258306) .

============= Below this is an opinion due to the 560 minimum words post. I did not intend to write opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

But today's war will not be like in the 1940s. Either we nuke each other or we strangle each other's economy. In other words, commodities shortage. I prefer the latter. So here I am, questioning redditors which you are going to bet pre and during the US-China war.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so wheat is a basic commodities to create instant noodles, bread, porridge, cereal. While beef is well you know, a source of protein. Asians eat noodles regularly, Italian eat pasta as well. It's an essential ingredients to create food. Alright, essentials do not mean it has no substitute but supply and demand does not change easily, at least the demand part. So for a time, when the supply drops, the demand will cause a price hike. I am not sure whether this will be good for a noodle company or any company which rely on Wheat.

*****THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE*****
I am not licensed or trained in the field of financial advisory/equities. I am just a guy with a computer, an MBA, and a passion for data. I am an amateur. Make decisions based on my research at your own risk. Full transparency: I currently do not have an open position with this company, but will likely open a position.

TL;DR: The technicals indicate Community Health Systems (CYH) stock may be oversold and a deep dive into the company indicates that they are getting back on track after several bad years.

The company:

Community Health Systems is a Fortune 500 company based in Franklin, Tennessee. It was the largest provider of general hospital healthcare services in the United States in terms of the number of acute care facilities. In 2014, CHS had around 200 hospitals, but the number had declined to around 85 in 2021. (source: Wikipedia)

What brought this stock to my attention:
See the chart below. I had set my stock screening script to market caps between 1b and 1t with a max share price of $45. This yielded 1,346 stocks for evaluation. I ended up with about 75 stocks that then met my criteria of meeting a particular RSI threshold or Bollinger percentage. Out of those, this stock jumped out in particular since it hit both the RSI threshold and Bollinger percentage, and is in a field I am familiar with (healthcare - I work for a large hospital system). There were a few pharm-tech/biotech stocks that met my criteria; however, I personally don't like those because they can be so volatile - one clinical trial doesn't yield the results you expect, and the stock craters. This stock is in a more stable industry that I am comfortable with.

Back to the technicals - This stock closed at $10.01 on Friday, which is 17.5% below its 20-day moving average of $12.13. The stock has a Bollinger percentage of .02 and, earlier this month crossed the lower Bollinger band which would have yielded a negative percentage. This is an indicator that the stock may be oversold. Pair this with an RSI below 30 (18.6), we have another indicator that this stock is oversold. Recall, RSIs above 70 indicate overbought stocks, and below 30 indicate oversold stocks. However, RSI is not an accurate price-movement-predictor for all stocks. For this particular stock, RSI has a 55% accuracy of predicting price movement (in my opinion for things like this, over 50% accuracy is good enough, particularly when paired with other indicators).

Beyond the technicals:

Now that I had some technicals to go off of, I did a deeper dive into the company.

The Bad:
-CYH has 12b in long-term debt
-Currently has a negative Book Value to Price Share
-in 2014 CYH operated 200 hospitals, but not operates 85
-Total liabilities is 1.5b more than assets
-Growth is negative at 1.5b

The Good:
-11b in revenue and 16b in assets
-Price to book ratio is below 1 and the PE ratio is 2.29 (average PE for stocks on the S&amp;P sits between 13 and 15)
-CYH has 1.67b in cash on hand which has been a major increase over the last 2 years
-Long term debt is high but trending down
-The balance sheet has improved consistently over the last 3 years.
-CYH has a positive free cash flow
-While growth is negative at 1.5b, growth has continually improved since being -2.14b in 2019
-Total liabilities are trending down
-Has beat earnings estimates for the past 3 quarters (next earnings release is 4/28)

Summary:

As a short-term play, CYH may beat earnings estimates again, and with the technicals indicating the stock being in oversold territory, there may be a small pop in the stock price to take advantage of. However, after diving into the company deeper, reading about the management team, and seeing the improvements over the last 2 years, this could be a good long-term healthcare play as well.",StockMarket,Analysis: Community Health Systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/msuh1b/analysis_community_health_systems/,True,submission

I have been going through a recruiting process and was not able to allocate as much time into the markets recently. You can expect to see less frequent memos going forward as I'm still navigating through the recruiting.

I wanted to discuss two things today.

1. A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.
2. How to trade bond and gold futures.

**1) A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.**

Stocks rose to new highs, including S&amp;P, Dow and Nasdaq.

What's notable is that the Nasdaq recovered from its ""rotation from growth to value"" correction.

📷

I mentioned in a series of market commentaries that this NASDAQ dip was most likely another buying opportunity.

3/16: 

3/29: 

What's also noteworthy is that the recovery was different for different types of stocks.

For instance, most of the names I mentioned that I felt bullish about, the growth-oriented ones, have not yet recovered to their previous highs. Examples are the following.

📷📷📷📷📷📷

As I've repeatedly mentioned before, I believe there's a value in buying these growth names at cheaper levels than before. These are businesses with strong moat and proven services trading at relatively reasonable/expensive levels.

Of course they could slip further, which will present yet another buying opportunity. Buying the dip is easy but holding it is the hard part.

**2) How to trade bond and gold futures.**

The reason why I bring this up now, which I should have done months ago, is that I see real opportunities in the two asset classes, specifically gold.

To explain futures a bit, they're really nothing more than leveraged assets.

For instance, similar to how most of the retail investors buy gold through GLD etf, gold futures represent the same thing except your position is 100x levered.

If you bought one GC (gold futures) contract, your exposure is $178,020, because GC closed at $1780.2 on Friday and it is magnified by 100x.

However, you are not actually holding $178k worth of gold futures or spending $178k to buy it. In fact, you just spent zero dollars to get $178k exposure, hence the leverage.

Although you need to maintain certain amount of cash to guarantee the futures position, it is a very minimal amount compared to the $178k exposure you're receiving.

If GC rises by 10%, or $178, then you also gain 10% on your futures, or $17,800, with minimal upfront costs.

On the other hand, if GC declines by 10%, then you also lose 10%, or $17,800.

It's very similar to options in that you get exposure to high amount of delta dollars for low upfront costs.

I personally like the leveraged feature of futures and that's why most investors use it to hedge or optimize their portfolios.

Here's CME's [page](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html) explaining the contract specs.

📷

Similarly, ticker ZB represents 30-year Treasury bond futures. I will explain this in more detail in the next memo.

Looking at GC, gold futures turned positive in recent days and is about to test the 100 MA resistance.

I have a few reasons for gold to benefit from a new bull market. This is a position for the intermediate-term, 1-3 years.

I will walk through the reasons behind gold in the next memo after the recruiting process is over. I just wanted to throw it out there in case anyone wanted to get ahead of their positions before any big upward movements.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the weekend!",StockMarket,Futures Trading Part I (Market Commentary and Gold futures) - 4/17/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mt064o/futures_trading_part_i_market_commentary_and_gold/,True,submission

Decentralized Exchange:
Transaction fee has grown to become a real issue in the crypto world. Ethereum based tokens take around $20 per transaction. To eradicate this, CryptoSwap’s decentralized exchange uses Binance Smart Chain to carry out transactions which take up minimal fees per transaction. 
Since the exchange is decentralized, it has no overheads due to which the whole process of swapping is cheap and secure. 

Crypto Farming and Staking:
Crypto farming and staking are undeniably the most lucrative ways to get a stable return on your locked up tokens. This process benefits both, the network and the user in a way that the user locks up a certain amount of CSF tokens (CryptoSwap’s native tokens) to provide liquidity to the network in exchange for a reward: CSF tokens. 

Crypto Lottery:
Another exciting feature in CryptoSwap’s ecosystem is crypto lottery. A user can buy lottery tickets through their CSF tokens. Getting the winning ticket numbers can result in huge crypto jackpots. 

The CSF token:
CryptoSwap has introduced CSF (Short for CryptoSwap Fianance) as the native token in their overall ecosystem. This token is a “must have” for users willing to join the network and use one of the aforementioned products. The token is priced at $3 for the initial sale with a total starting supply of 350,000 CSF. 60% of this supply would be used for the public sale, 20% is planned to go for exchange listings while the rest of the supply goes to marketing, airdrops, and team members. 
All-in-all, we’re in a time where DeFi is booming and we’re here to witness it. Establishing low cost and fast financial products in crypto was a gap that projects like CSF aim to fix. Although the project is still in its infancy, technological potential shows how brilliant it can go on to be in the future as the company proceeds in accordance with the roadmap. Even for the investors, the initial coin sale seems to be something to keep an eye out for because it is expected that the product launch would bring in huge volumes in the token which would help the price surge.

This post is not mine, I borrowed/re-shared from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) because I found it helpful, and wanted to share with other newer investors like myself!

**Original post:**

A   lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when   considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this   guide together on the things I look at. I updated my post from 2 months   ago, to include links, and expand on some points.

(Before  we begin, I do want  to take a quick moment to mention, that ETFs are  the safer route (than  ""stock picking"") due to diversification. But, any   newer investors should consider ETFs before ""picking stocks"". Some  some  ETF's I own are: $MGC for MegaCap, $IVV for S&amp;P 500, $QQQ for   NASDAQ, $VGT for Tech, $VOT for MidCap, $VBK for SmallCap, $ARK for   Innovation. With that being said, anyone who wants to do some   ""educated""/ ""researched"" gambling, keep reading.

There   points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock,   and where I get them from.  At  the end of the day, this is your money,  and noone cares more about it  than you do.

2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

* **Growth**.   I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news,   10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future   growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will   the company scale?
* **Financial health**.   Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are  cash  flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing   Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is   the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income   Statement Trend, etc.

If it does drop it's a no brainer try to buy the bottom.  But, could it possibly go higher as the demand for copper is still high even with inflated prices? 

I guess I really would like some insight to what the future price movement could do and why. I could see both scenarios playing out, but I'm pretty new to investing and I am complexed about the current situation.

Decentralized Exchange:
Transaction fee has grown to become a real issue in the crypto world. Ethereum based tokens take around $20 per transaction. To eradicate this, CryptoSwap’s decentralized exchange uses Binance Smart Chain to carry out transactions which take up minimal fees per transaction. 
Since the exchange is decentralized, it has no overheads due to which the whole process of swapping is cheap and secure. 

Crypto Farming and Staking:
Crypto farming and staking are undeniably the most lucrative ways to get a stable return on your locked up tokens. This process benefits both, the network and the user in a way that the user locks up a certain amount of CSF tokens (CryptoSwap’s native tokens) to provide liquidity to the network in exchange for a reward: CSF tokens. 

Crypto Lottery:
Another exciting feature in CryptoSwap’s ecosystem is crypto lottery. A user can buy lottery tickets through their CSF tokens. Getting the winning ticket numbers can result in huge crypto jackpots. 

The CSF token:
CryptoSwap has introduced CSF (Short for CryptoSwap Fianance) as the native token in their overall ecosystem. This token is a “must have” for users willing to join the network and use one of the aforementioned products. The token is priced at $3 for the initial sale with a total starting supply of 350,000 CSF. 60% of this supply would be used for the public sale, 20% is planned to go for exchange listings while the rest of the supply goes to marketing, airdrops, and team members. 
All-in-all, we’re in a time where DeFi is booming and we’re here to witness it. Establishing low cost and fast financial products in crypto was a gap that projects like CSF aim to fix. Although the project is still in its infancy, technological potential shows how brilliant it can go on to be in the future as the company proceeds in accordance with the roadmap. Even for the investors, the initial coin sale seems to be something to keep an eye out for because it is expected that the product launch would bring in huge volumes in the token which would help the price surge.

I think we all have been noticing that despite the broad market rally in the S&amp;P, Nasdaq, DJI, there are a certain group of stocks that have barely moved, or in fact declined. I've observed that they fall into two main categories 1) SPACs, 2) 'reddit' stocks (like NIO or PLTR off the top of my head). 

Especially when the March correction was attributed to the bond yield spike that raised fears of inflation and interest rates hikes that would devalue the future earnings of a lot of these growth stocks ,where a lot has been priced based on their uncertain future earnings. However, we have seen yields start to **cool off**, allowing tech in general to rally hard, but not the aforementioned stocks. 

So I've really been scratching my head trying to figure out, why is this the case? I've thought of / came across some ideas, and really wanna find out what other people think or whether anyone can shed some light for me.

1) Meet Kevin pointed out that SPACs may still be suffering because of **SEC investigations** into them that is generating a lot of **uncertainty**. 

2) Another thought I came across is that a lot of these stocks were propped up by retail investors using **margin**, and when the correction occurred, many got margin called and **lost their capital**. This is even more pronounced for those who had been dumping a lot of their money into call options, fueled by euphoria, and eventually got devastated when the risk they were ignoring/negligent of reared its ugly head. Essentially, the correction in those high beta stocks **wiped out** a **great deal of retail investors' capital**, leaving them with **little firepower to buy the dip**, and hence the poor performance of these stocks. 

3) It may just be a technical consequence, where these stocks had went on a **euphoric climax** (too high, too fast), and when the rug got pulled and the dust settled, its natural that they will have to take their time to find some footing before they recover in the long run. One can consider a **rotation** perspective as well where these relatively smaller growth stocks / SPACs **strongly outperformed** even the Big Boys like AAPL, AMZN and FB during the past few months. Now, its the other way around. Of course, the psychology behind this technical observation may be explained by point 2 and point 4.

4) After the sharp correction in March due to bond yields and inflation scare, not forgetting the **archegos saga**, institutions and their **risk compliance committees** may have shaken off some euphoria of their own, got reminded that such stocks have a tremendous amount of future expectations baked in (and hence **greater risk**) that would be hard of them to swallow at these prices, and adopted a more **risk-off** stance towards such stocks, rotating back into more consistent, proven and stable plays like that of Big Tech. In a nutshell, institutions are **more wary and not as willing** to enter these stocks at this point in time. 

Please let me know what you guys think. Am really trying to find a *satisfactory explanation* for myself because personally I'm holding on to quite a number of such stocks and its lowkey demoralizing to see them continue to slowly bleed even though the market pushed into ATHs. 

There are also **no fundamental changes** in most of these companies, hence I cannot find a reason for myself to sell out (the *bagholding* begins). That being said, the drop in prices in some potentially promising names have made them more **attractive** and am considering adding more to my positions (just afraid of a **further decline** caused when the broader markets start to **cool off** after their **big moves up**). 

Just want to encourage and remind everyone, that when we invest, we are investing in the **company**, not the stock. \*Insert quotes about market being a weighing machine blah blah\*. Hopefully, we can take this time to do further DD and **reinforce our convictions** towards what we hold, and then baghold **proudly** and without shame.",StockMarket,Why are some stocks declining in the midst of a market rally?

Suez Canal Tanker Play

$STNG $TNK $NAT $TK $FRO

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically $STNG and $NAT, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa now. I think this could be the black swan event that kicks off a supercycle for the entire shipping industry.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in $STNG to play product tankers and $TNK to play crude.

If you have invested in **AACQ, PDAC, DMYI, GWAC, RTP, ACIC, QELL,NPA, HOL (+ several other ones, but these are the ones that are hyped up at times** ) you have to **be very cautious.**

\--&gt;according companies : Origin Materials, LI- CYCLE, IONQ, CYPHERmining, joby, archer, possibly lilium, spacemobile, astra

\--&gt;According Industries : battery recycling, Quantum computing, bitcoin mining, Electric aviation, global continuous mobile connection with no imput lag or connection loss, space launching.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-**Key take** ( **You have the right vision, but value matters, certainly with rising inflation in the upcoming years )**

I get it all these industries seem and are very enticing in the future, and you want to bet on the future. The stockmarket is forward looking, but value matters. **75% off the above stated companies will be tremendous winners in the future. But 90 % of these companies will fall below 10$ instantly after the merger.** why? no revenue for the years to come, and if they somehow have revenue in 2023, or 2024, they will be trading at 50-500x price to sales ratio.

**All the above stories can be the leaders in the according industries. ( 3 examples of possible winners )**

**Cypher mining ( GWAC** ) --&gt; possibly the biggest bitcoin miner (hashrate wise ) and market leader in **2022/2023**

**Li-CYCLE ( PDAC ) --&gt;** possibly the market leader in battery recycling, as the ev boom will ramp up towards 2030 ( numerous catalysts and deadlines for example CO2 emission cars will be banned in the uk by 2030 ), so lythium recycling will be a must in the future by **2024-2025**, pdac will likely explode ( imo)

**ARCHER (ACIC), JOBY (RTP), LYLIUM (QELL,ZNTE, i don't care who acquire them, I won't invest ) --&gt;**

Elecrtic transportation will be the future,and these badboys will take part in this and acquire a percentage of the market share along side boeing, etc ( who is also developing electric airplanes so a lot of competition here ), the aviation industry will only start adopting the ev aviation wave by **2025-2026, if you are lucky the transition will start in 2024 ( this is stated by numerous airlines that they are not ready to transition yet )**

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*notice, from the time of writing, these companies will only start generating possible revenue by 2023,2024,2025,2026,**

this is min  2 years from now, so these are all current unicorns ( trading above 1 Billion dollars)by market cap, but without fukking revenue and once they start making revenue in 2023,2024, they will be trading at 100x500x price to sales ratio's , the real ramp ups are projected for 2025-2026 most of the time, this is 5 years from now.

**\*\*\* notice, consider countless risk factors, ( 3 examples of what can go wrong )**

\---- &gt; **pdac,aacq**, construction of facilities--&gt; construction delays, projections won't be met....

\----&gt; **archer, joby**, problems with prototype models , can delay start of commercial sales....

\----&gt; **hol**, not a fukking single rocket launched to date, prototype issues, no proven product, several risk factors

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*\*intermezzo ( the tesla story ) , why catalysts matter.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

before you say, but big poppa, every fukking tech stock went on  massive tear, and went up, all stocks went up in 2020, hyperloop bull market babay , I say yes, but not like tesla, and many growth stocks wont maintain current levels, because they cant support the year over year growth in their respective sectors, Tesla will.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxxcmuzorop61.png?width=1468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e18f718adb633e62d8da93fcc594e48df28a1531

&amp;#x200B;

**TESLA catalysts were ( in 2019-2020 )**

\- goal attained of  the production and delivery of  500 000 cars in 2020 ( not covid or bull market related )

\- (1 on chart) first 5 profitable quarters ( 5 consecutive ones )  started in 2019 ( not covid or bull market related

\- (2 on chart) inclusion in the snp 500 ( due to these profitable quarters ( requirement for snp inclusion ), not covid or bull market related )

**Consensus, I'm betting my left fukking nut, that tesla would have been trading at 400+ right now even without the covid crisis and the tech ramp up, because they had so many catalyst coming up starting in 2019.**

\*\*\* note if you followed tesla closely ( tracked their balance sheets, followed up on projections and goals ), you knew all these catalyst were coming up  or had a high likelyhood of being attained.

**TESLA catalyst was  (in 2012)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nbf2mcqrop61.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10d6897ae121835437e2fd99c7f05cd727f47334

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

as you see, tesla was hyped starting 15 years ago, but when should you have invested 2008 no, **2012,** that's when the revenue ramp up started  and the cars were adopted by the public ( proven products and proven growth by then ) and the share price exploded from 6 dollars to 40 dollars ( wowa those were the magic days, and yes these numbers were projected, so you could have anticipated on that catalyst, as you can now with the current promising companies and their projections. )

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Outro ( Don't fomo just because of your future conictions )**

**recommendation** : **Get the fukk out now, while you still can**, or explode with the bubble, **BUT,** write these fukking companies down, follow their progress, and schedule catalysts in. when will the factories be completed?; when will they start commercial sales, when will the factories start running, when will they report the first revenues, when will they launch their first fukking rocket, follow them closely, invest in them once the catalysts are ramping up after each other. From the above stated companies, you will have tesla stories in different industries ( scale up wise ), these companies have unlimited potential, but this is future potential, with no catalyst right now. use your brain and bide your time to strike.

(\*\*\* if you can't escape your fomo feaver, and you are scared these companies will explode right now ( highly unlikely ) , I recommend you start a very small starter position now, if you truly have high conviction in these plays, and you average down once the share price plummets after the mergers.

**free info and my plan** : based on revenue ramp up and investor presentations ( + variables along the way) I  will invest in the following companies by timeframe and because I have the  highest conviction in them an the value they could offer ( if they achieve earlier revenue projections and facilities are set up according to these projections and they still have the same revenue ramp up outlook.)

**NPA: end of 2023,  start of 2024**

**AACQ : end of 2024,  start of 2025**

**GWAC : end of 2022, start of 2023**

**PDAC: end of 2024, start of 2024**

**EVtols: ACIC, RTP, QELL:  2024 range**

Full disclosure! : no position in any of the spacs mentioned in this thread for all the reasons stated above and because I'm not a  sufferer of the FOMO feaver, I'm dead inside. I will 100% start a postion in some of these companies in the future for all the reasons stated above.",StockMarket,"Be cautious, play the catalysts, play the value ramp up and growth. play it smart.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/metb7y/be_cautious_play_the_catalysts_play_the_value/,True,submission

I thought Friday March 26th was going to be like Friday March 5th,

 instead it's going to be Monday March 29th, Monday opening dip to possibly new lows.

The weekly says it needs to happen. Do you seriously think they let the monthly chart just let go like it is right now.. no because then we have another MARCH 2020 Market crash, this is just a correction for 2021. There has never been 2 market crash in 2 consecutive years in a row, learn from the past.

So in order to not lose the monthly, the dip needs to happen on Monday then we come right back up and end at a reasonable spot for Wednesday March 31st the most important day of the month.

That dip on Monday cannot happen on Tuesday or Wednesday because it won't have enough time to bounce back up to a reasonable level for March 31st.

If the dip doesn't happen on Monday that means it will happen on Thursday April 1st or Friday April 2nd and hopefully by mid April the market starts going up for good.

If you don't stay in the market long term many years before cashing out then I do the following to give me better odds:

In general, January is the best month it goes sideways or uptrend , March is the worst month it goes sideways or downtrend.

I usually 

- Sell before Valentine's Day at the best price you can
- Buy at the best price I can get in March (usually I try to predict close to where I think the company wants to drop its stock)

- Buy end of year best price Nov-Dec
- Sell end of year best price Sept-Oct",StockMarket,The entire market looks horrendous on the weekly chart and 3 days left to confirm the monthly chart.,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mezsyx/the_entire_market_looks_horrendous_on_the_weekly/,True,submission

Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. ",StockMarket,FYI: Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – media,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mf5n4k/fyi_wall_street_banks_ditch_19_billion_of_stocks/,True,submission

The Wall Street bank sold $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. before the market opened in the U.S, according to an email to clients seen by Bloomberg News.

That move was followed by the sale of $3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc., Farfetch Ltd., iQiyi Inc. and GSX Techedu Inc., the email said.

More of the unregistered stock offerings were said to be managed by Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter, on behalf of one or more undisclosed shareholders. Some of the trades exceeded $1 billion in individual companies, calculations based on Bloomberg data show.

Wall Street is now collectively speculating on the identity of the mysterious seller or sellers. The liquidation triggered price swings for every stock involved in the high-volume transactions, rattling traders and prompting talk that a hedge fund or family office was in trouble and being forced to sell.

Several major investment banks with ties to hedge fund Archegos Capital Management LLC liquidated holdings, contributing to the slump in share prices of ViacomCBS and Discovery, IPO Edge reported, citing people it didn’t identify. CNBC reported forced sales by Archegos were probably related to margin calls on heavily leveraged positions. Archegos is controlled by former Julian Robertson protege and Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang.

Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos’s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn’t returned.

Price Swings

In block trades, large volumes of securities are privately negotiated between parties, usually outside of open market.

Friday’s selloff dragged companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and NetEase Inc. lower. The peers later recovered after traders said word of the offerings lessened fears that a broader trade was unfolding throughout the sector.

(Can skip this part:)

Pretty new to buying higher risk stocks. Have some money in some ETFs. But now wanting to expand and try my hand on some stocks that are a bit riskier (in the $5-10/share area).  With 100% understanding and acceptance that I could lose it all or shoot to the moon. Mostly just trying to gain some experience with some “fun money” so I can improve my knowledge and understanding with the self-taught lessons I’ve been doing online the past couple months. (Eg videos, Reddit edu, etc)

Been researching some pharmaceutical and other healthcare stocks since I’m a pharmacist and probably the best advice I’ve gotten is to look into stocks in a field that I know. So I’ve been looking at different drug trials, trends in therapies, etc, and seeing what different competitors are doing as well and whatnot. 

(Background to my question:)

There are a couple stocks that I’m looking at and been also looking at the trends of when prices have been going up and down throughout each day. And there is one stock that has a trend of spiking a bit right when markets open, and then falling below open price after about 30-60 min after open. Then normalizes again. (Sidebar: is this common occurrence? is there a name for this semi-rapid phenomenon?) Regardless of whether the stock that day is on an upward or downward trajectory. The absolute change and the percentage change however, aren’t as predictable. Now of course there is no guarantee that this will for sure be the case tomorrow.  

So mostly my question is:

When coming out of a weekend. Especially an extended weekend like this one. Would it be better to put in a limit order before market open with a conservative price below market open? Or, would it be better to just wait for market to open and see if this same trend happens and try to put in a limit order after I see how it reacts?

Keeping in mind I’m usually working during most of the open market time with no real access to my phone during the work day. So my only real time to be active is during the first few hours of market open and during my “lunch break”, if I get one. 

This is more in a situation where I only plan to hold a stock short term and not trying to go for the long game and hold. Trying to learn to read how companies are doing, current events, and anticipate possible opportunities in short term boosts in share prices. (Definitely not looking for the next GME, trying to do this off of DD) 

P.s. Sorry for the vagueness. Trying to get more of an answer on general stock buying theory, rather than bombarded with people telling me which stock is going to the moon. Plenty of those posts to peruse through already. 

P.s.s. Sorry for the long post. Brevity is not my strong suit. 

TLDR:
Noob here. Short window of 2hrs at market open each day to actively trade. When is best time to put in limit buy order? Before market open, or see beginning trend and put in order after?

The only hurdle for WeedMaps to jump through is regulations and legalization. Even Alabama is letting people smoke the ganja now.. plus Chuck Shumer (Senate majority leader) said it is a main focus of Congress to pass federal marijuana legalization laws.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR INFORMATIVE PURPOSES - POSITIONS LISTED BELOW.**

Stock is Piedmont Lithium, ticker PLL which is dual listed on the NASDAQ (last US$53.74) and ASX (last AU$0.73).

**Background**: Piedmont lithium is a exploratory (close to production) miner of lithium, with it's primary operations based right outside Charlotte NC. Their current trajectory is to start mining spodumene contrctrate by the middle of this year and become the worlds cheapest, per tonne, producer of lithium hydroxide. The company is in it's final stages of obtaining all the necessary permits for mining and chemical processing out of NC and the basic idea is that because they will be able to mine and produce the end product within a close proximity they will be able to outperform other South American miners (that produce lithium from brine which needs to be shipped to China to get the final product). Company is relatively small cap at $767M and but liquidity is decent at 1.1M average volume. 

[https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/908664/piedmont-lithium-secures-landmark-section-404-permit-to-advance-its-north-carolina-lithium-project-908664.html](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/908664/piedmont-lithium-secures-landmark-section-404-permit-to-advance-its-north-carolina-lithium-project-908664.html)

**Notable news:**

* Supply deal with Tesla: [https://stockhead.com.au/resources/tesla-supplier-piedmont-lithium-expects-more-deals-with-carmakers/](https://stockhead.com.au/resources/tesla-supplier-piedmont-lithium-expects-more-deals-with-carmakers/)

This one is pretty old news, from Oct-20, so the intial hype is priced in. But I think it's important to highlight espeacially for those of you who want exposure to TSLA without going balls deep.

* Expanding supply with deal with Sayona Mining: [https://stockhead.com.au/resources/piedmont-lithium-and-sayona-mining-deal-highlights-importance-of-local-projects-to-us-ev-makers/](https://stockhead.com.au/resources/piedmont-lithium-and-sayona-mining-deal-highlights-importance-of-local-projects-to-us-ev-makers/)

Shortening of supply chains and securing reliable sources of lithium is extremly important in the long run. As the current biggest controller of end product lithium is China (as most of the worlds mined lithium needs to be sent there for processing).

A reliance on China in the long run is not great due to obvious reasons, and also the costs associated of shipping the stuff often makes even the cheapest lithium mines very expensive.

**Financials**

As I mentioned, PLL is still in it's final exploration stage and obtaining permits for it's operations.

Over the last quarter Dec-20 their cash burn from operating and investing activities was $4.1M (or $8.6M 6 months to date).

The also recently raised additional equity during the period which left their total Cash and equivalents at $70M at the end of the period.

Looking a bit further into their annual report for 2020, they made a loss of $6.1M for 2020, down from -$10.1M in 2019 (due to the exploratory nature).

On the balance sheet their Net assets sat at $24M (pre-equity raising) with little to no liabilities.

Overall a strong balance sheet and P&amp;L that can sustain the current rate of cash burn for sometime in the negative event of mining delays and other hiccups.

I recommend taking a dive into the financials yourself.

**Global lithium demand/supply**

So outside of the fact that PLL is positioning iteself to be a scalable, low cost, local producer of lithium hydroxide the elephant in the room is, does the world need more lithium?

And is demand and supply moving in such a way that pricing works in the our favour?

The cost of lithium has steadily declined over the past years partly due to the economies of scale that producers achieve as they ramp up production but also cost efficiencies achieved from advances in extraction and processing techniques.

I believe we are at at a turning point, or at least a price stablisation equilibrium as the demand for lithium increases due to the expanding domestic and commercial use for it. [https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/lithium-prices-move-out-of-gloom/](https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/lithium-prices-move-out-of-gloom/)

I think the reality of our slowly decarbonising future is that we need storage solutions for electricity for when the sun don't shine and wind doesn't blow. The current technologies that are showing any decent scalability is Lithium batteries and Hydrogen. Lithium is far more advanced in terms of development and it is my view, and Papa Elon's that lithium will be here to stay as a core resource that will enable us to move into a wider EV market, power storage and decarbonised world.

**The play**

Personally I am in on PLL for over 10,000 shares (@AU$0.45), my play is mid to long term as a look towards the commencement of commercial operations this year as well as seeing how the global appetite will move as EV's start to overtake internal combustion.

As much as I like TSLA, its too expensive for my taste and something like buying into the supply chain for the exposure to any upside in TSLA seems very reasonable to me.

One benefit of GME's recent phenomenon is that it brought a lot of attention to aspects of how the short market works. And also there's been an awareness to sorts of data that is available for review. Personally, I was aware 13F filings and the SEC's short interest report. In the course of GME's roller coaster, I became aware of S3 Partners and Ortex, and data that they provide. So there's been opportunities to learn more about how certain markets operate and the data that is available to help guide decisions that investors may make.

In various subs, there's been continual updates of short interest data. Every day it seems there's a post about how the hedge funds didn't close their positions...or if they did, they opened new ones, so GME is still over shorted. 

While I think this information is educational. I also think that there is a shortcoming of these kinds of declarations, and that they have the potential for being misleading or irresponsible. What I don't see in these kinds of posts is analysis of what this information actually is supposed to suggest. I think the most popular sentiment is that reading these facts ultimately forces the reader to make assumptions about what this information means...and since the OPs don't usually provider a particular stance, I think most readers take these posts as an assurance of sorts to indicate that they should continue to hold GME and/or not to lose faith because either another squeeze must happen OR that they'll be able to recover their unrealized losses. 

Obviously we know that you can lose unless you sell, but I think that if a person is going to tout how ""the hedge funds still didn't close"", that it should be incumbent upon them to state why the fact that they didn't close their positions (or did close them but opened new ones) should have any meaningful value to people who hold the fund.

It's tantamount to making an argument by innuendo where the reader becomes responsible for drawing a conclusion about the beneficial value of the information that is provided.

As someone who isn't holding any bags on GME but is interested in the dynamics of short interest, I've been curious to know if the hedge funds' strategy of delaying the significant closing out of short positions is tenable, and if so, for how long. And in what way do fails-to-deliver impact when the hedge funds have to make good on their obligation? Or perhaps some cost comparison between the cost of short interest vs the cost of having to make good on their fail to delivers.

For many, the answer to these kinds of questions might give some people a hope of thinking another squeeze is probable and it might give people a belief of when they can expect an uptrend on the stock price. People will find a reason to hold out hope regardless. I just think that if people want to tout how the shorts are still out there, then there should be some sort of aspect of their post that addresses the question of ""what am I supposed to conclude from this information?""",StockMarket,Can anyone shed light on how short interest impacts when shorters need to close out their position?,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lkwlfl/can_anyone_shed_light_on_how_short_interest/,True,submission

The go to piece of advice lots of new investors get is to invest based on a company's ""fundamentals."" P/E ratio, cash flows, and so on. If things line up to paint a pretty picture for a firm, then it should be a great investment.

Problem is, a stock's price is simply based on the supply and demand of those shares, not on how profitable a company is. Even the most profitable company in the world would quickly hit an equilibrium share price due to the nature of supply and demand. Only the quick get rewarded.

It seems to me that trading on fundamentals is actually a short term play where the market hasn't yet ""caught up"" to incur a price change in a stock. I would think a long term investor should NOT be investing on fundamentals, but instead should be operating through a long term prediction that the market has not accounted for.

This is to say, I believe for any retail investor especially, who gets their info WAY later than Wall Street, fundamentals are already ""priced in.""


Here is a thought experiment.

Say a company has an outstanding cash flow, great return on assets, P/E ratio is reasonable, and all the works. An earnings report comes up, and just as all these ""fundamentals"" estimated, it leads to a great earnings. But... the stock price then wouldn't change at all, right? If expectations are met perfectly, a stock's price shouldn't change at all, no?

So I figure that the only real way to beat the market is to make predictions that everyone else isn't seeing rather than operating on ""fundamentals"" that the whole world is up to date on.

“But what about the poor souls who invested before the crash? Didn’t they lose a lot? The short answer for long-term investors again is perhaps not. Equity returns were so explosive in the years prior to the bubble bursting that many were never left underwater. Even at the market’s nadir in April 2003, an investor who had bought 20 years earlier would have an 83% return. That isn’t bad in a land largely without inflation.”

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-16-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq set to add to record highs

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, adding to Friday’s record closes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. All three stock benchmarks finished higher last week, in a continuation of February’s strength. For the year, as of Friday’s close, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up nearly 2.8%, 4.8% and 9.4%, respectively.

&gt; * The 30-year Treasury yield held above 2% early Tuesday as investors watched for progress on President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package on Capitol Hill and the push for wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to more than 1.26%.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bitcoin hit a new high over $50,000

&gt; * Bitcoin reached a new record high Tuesday, going over $50,000 per unit for the first time ever, before paring some of those gains. Major firms announced support for digital currencies last week, starting with Tesla revealing it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Mastercard said Thursday it would support certain cryptocurrencies later this year, while BNY Mellon announced the following day it would open up its custody services to digital assets. Bitcoin more than quadrupled in 2020 and it’s up over 60% since the start of this year.

*****

&gt; # 3. Deep freeze in Texas causes massive energy crunch

&gt; * More than 3.8 million households in Texas are in the dark Tuesday morning, as record low temperatures boosted demand for power for heat that pushed the state’s electric grid to its limits. Rolling blackouts, typically seen on 100-degree summer days, were imposed in Texas. The scarcity of power was so great that spot prices of wholesale electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. U.S. oil prices also climbed to a pandemic-high above $60 per barrel. The frigid weather was part of a massive winter blast that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains, across parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

*****

&gt; # 4. Congress to establish a Capitol riot commission

&gt; * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that Congress will establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Rules Committee.

&gt; * House impeachment prosecutors who argued for Donald Trump’s conviction of inciting the attack said Sunday that they proved their case. Democrats also railed against Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, saying they were “trying to have it both ways” in finding the former president not guilty while criticizing him.

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden to make first official domestic trips

&gt; * Trying to move beyond Trump’s acquittal in last week’s impeachment trial, Biden plans to keep up a busy schedule focused on the coronavirus in the coming week. Biden is set to make his first official domestic trips of his presidency, starting with a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday to talk to Americans impacted by the pandemic. Biden on Thursday then visits a Pfizer Covid vaccine facility in Michigan as the drugmaker’s two-shot regime and Moderna’s start making more inroads into pharmacies around the nation.

The deal had reportedly been the subject of protests to regulators by Alphabet (GOOGL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Nonetheless, Nvidia shares rose 1.2% in premarket action.

&gt; **Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)** – Bristol and French partner Sanofi (SNY) will pay more than $834 million to Hawaii in a case involving the blood-thinning drug Plavix. The state had accused the drugmakers of failing to warn non-white patients of the risks associated with the drug.

I am in the very early phase of a start-up in which we try to make satellite data available for private investors.

At the moment big hedge funds are already using satellite images to try to predict the stock market (e.g. by looking at the change in concentration of cars on parking lots of specific companies they may be able predict changes in revenue and invest accordingly).

We want to make this approach useable for private investors and thereby (hopefully) reduce this disadvantage.

As I wrote: we are in the very early stages, therefore we would be very happy, if you would provide us with some information (stuff like whether or not you could imagine yourself using this data to make decisions etc.) - we both need ideas and an indication of who our users would be - and if anybody is interested at all.

I'm investing médium shor term/scalping/trading. Mostly speculating for almost a year. - I say speculating, because i don't go deep in company económics. I use more whats happening with the world, to chose my stocks

The thing is, i just don't seem to make real profit.

The companys i choose, they grow. Not always of course, and i'm ok with that. But i only enter in the One that falls, or dosen't go up. I might choose 5, Invest in 1, and that is the One that don't goes up. 

And i'm like ""alright, no problem. I give it a fall limit. If it reaches, i sell"". And it reaches, and i sell, and it goes up - the limit can be -5% till -20% of what i put in that stock

What is more ridículos, is that i Share my DD with friends, and they make profit. One friend of mine, as made 4x his small portfólio going all in on my DDs. 

I know alot of people say ""if i buy, it falls, if i sell it grows"". But this is happening almost every time.

I have Lost -20% of my total portfolio. At the moment i'm +10% in profit (Over a year), thanks to the cannabis boom, that i left way to early. This is making me remove my profits always way to early. But at the same time, if i don't i endup losing them...

I try to not fall in FOMO, i'm never in a rush to invest.

A common Misconception- is that People should be more trusted and believed, if they speak well when representing a position. Many of us Assume that if the person sounds so Intelligent- that we certainly should believe them. There is nothing wrong with Questioning a persons claim of Due Diligence. However- the more important part is "" How does that Information affect the Worth of the Stock ??   For Example "" Lets say the xyz Bubble Gum Factory is Expanding into 10 more Countries and Investing $5 Billion in new Factories. Lets say they Hired the Best Bubble Gum Salesforce ever and have the Market Cornered.. They have convinced you that 80% of the Worlds Bubblegum would be sold by this xyz company.. WOW-- Thats huge.. Gotta have this Stock .... You buy the Stock... You lose your money.. You are lost as to why ? Maybe the Market Cap was just too high.. But Wait--- A Large Cap is Supposed to be safer !!  Is It ???  Or does it Indicate too much excitement and Investments into it and it did not represent a Fair Value at purchase time.. Market Capitalization is the Money Stock Holders Invested. It has nothing to do with Financials of the Company. If 80% of the World supply of Bubblegum is worth $300 Million a Year and the company is Netting 40% Profit that means its worth $120 Million a year. If you have valued the company at 12 Billion and it Nets 120 Million a year you would have a Price to Earnings of 100, THATS RIDICULOUS.. Yet that is what is happening in some of the Biggest companies that Exceed 3 Trillion Market Cap. I agree Electric Cars and Green Energy and Marijuana and Blockchain ALL have Big Growth ahead... However-- there still is a need for Valuation of Stocks. With Established Stocks with Past Earnings that is easy. When we are looking to future Income we can only Guesstimate Value.. Due Diligence requires we answer these questions rather than just pushing a Stock because we hope others will lift us out of our Rut from Bad Investment.. Do you Value the Stock ? Or do you just throw a Dart and then try to Convince others its a BullsEye ??

The safest thing you can do during a downturn is shift into undervalued stocks (not necessarily traditional ""value stocks""). When everything is trading at an extreme premium, it's a good idea to move into stocks that are trading at a discount. I dont see most cruises/oil/airlines as value because there's a difference between plain cheap and undervalued. Undervalued stocks are good businesses whose price for whatever reason has not kept up with a companies outlook. Below are some of my personal favorites at the moment.

#Cyclical

MED- how can a company whose price has increased 626% in the last 5 years be undervalued? By being a top 5 fastest growing company (source: Forbes). Forward p/e and ev/EBITDA are both under 20 and peg is near 1. The profit margin and growth rate are mouth watering. With a market cap of just 2.4b they have miles and miles to run. They shouldn't be this cheap.

LKQ- A peg ratio of just 0.48 and managing to grow earnings in a pandemic earns them a spot on this list. The last 2 earnings have beat estimates by 231% and 41% respectively. They're expected to grow by 33.5% per annum the next 5 years, astounding considering their low multiplies. By every metric they're extremely underpriced and not for any negative reasons.

Honorable mention: LGIH

#Defensive

ACI- They're growing faster than Kroger and trading at lower multiples. Peg ratio of 0.3 is almost unheard of. Their debt remains fairly high from the Safeway purchase several years ago but it's really paid off in growth. As they continue knocking down long term liabilities we'll see them climb closer to $30.

Honorable mention: DG

#Industrial

BLD- One of the 16 companies that come up when screening a strict combination of growth and value measurements. Home improvement will continue to be popular as people move out of cities and work from home remains part of the modern work life. Excellent margins and expected EPS growth.

Honorable mentions: CSL

#Tech

CACI- This more mature version of PLTR has a great price/free cash flow ratio, low forward p/e and ev/EBITDA, good profit margins, and substantial growth. They've taken a loss of 8% over the last year in share price while nearly maintaining their growth rate through the pandemic. Solid margin of safety here and possiblity for a huge jump in price at some point.

SNX- They recently spun off their sibling company CNXC and it was expected that SNX would see slowed growth while CNXC grew rapidly. The first earnings report since the split showed the exact opposite to be the case. A bit weird seeing a tech company trade at an 8 pe, especially considering how business has picked up recently. A steady performer that won't fall far in a crash.

SSNC- earnings in 2018? 103m. Earnings in 2019? 438m. Earnings in 2020 through 3 quarters? 430m. They continue to grow earnings yet the share price has risen a meager 6% the last year. Peg ratio under 1, profit margin at 12%, and an excellent price/free cash flow make this a great discounted buy.

Honorable mention: JBL

#Communication

FB- The 1st really big name on the list. Nothing seems to stand in the way of their growth but we've only seen modest returns for it. Theres always the risk of them being forced to break up but the sum of the parts are worth more than the whole in this case. With the overall market froth you'd expect these guys to be at $300 by now.

#Healthcare

HZNP- They blasted off into profitability last year and havent looked back. Their multiples are much too low for a company experiencing this much success. Hedge fund interest plotted on a chart over the last year is is a vertical line straight up. Intrinsic value from dcf puts this at just over $100 while it trades at $78. One of the most undervalued stocks imo.

HUM- Theres no reason this should be below $450 but here we are. Their return in capital is at 24% where the industry average is 10%. An encouraging sign for future growth. The multiples look great as well.

Honorable mention: ELMD

#Financial

PJT- While looking at their share price gain and p/e compared to the rest of the financial sector you'd think I was crazy for calling this stock undervalued. A deeper look will point out just how undervalued they are. Through 3 quarters they've already beat 2018 and 2019's earnings combined. That puts their peg ratio at 0.7. Much too low. Charting their revenue and earnings out over the last few years paints an impressive picture of sustainable growth. 

PFSI- The number one most underpriced stock in the entire market. Period. 3.3 p/e and 0.1 peg ratio. All while exhibiting unbelievable growth and margins. Hedge funds are stuffing into this stock like a clown car, the number of funds investing in them has doubled in just one year. I believe the market has priced in a ""top"" of the housing market. By the time it actually starts to decline we'll see interest rates rise which should only help PFSI.

Honorable mention: OMF

#Real Estate

CBRE- Like OMF this stock got hurt by the pandemic but should be back on track this year. They have an impressive 30.5% margin of safety. The robust balance sheet supports the acquisition moves aimed at expanding their geographical reach.

#Basic Materials

GOLD- Warren Buffet was on the right track buying Barrick last year and the reasoning hasn't really changed. Massive stimulus building supports the gold bull case long term. 

Honorable mention: FMC

#Utilities

DTE- Only one utility company is expected to see EPS growth while having a forward p/e under 30, a peg ratio under 3, and decent price/cash flow. I dont have them being notably under intrinsic value but if you're going to own a utility that isnt renewable this is the one.",StockMarket,The undervalued discount portfolio,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kz2c65/the_undervalued_discount_portfolio/,True,submission

My main goal with the 90% would be to beat inflation at least, and not worry too much about losing out.


With the rest, I'd like to do research etc but I find the options to be a little overwhelming as the are too many companies to research. I have found that by the time I've looked in to company and decided to invest, I have missed the boat so to speak. Is there a way to quickly narrow my focus?

Bulls:

1. **Content**: Largest home-grown content which is quite diverse, adult oriented, edgier as compared to Disney + which is more directed towards children. Also have some long running popular shows (Ozark, Crown) etc. as compared to content from competition which is relatively new. This is important as The Office was the most streamed show in 2020. People value good content.
2. **Data**: from millions of users across all devices, numerous countries etc. etc. This helps to decide how to spend money on production/acquisition. While the presence of this worth is recognized, its quantification is subjective.
3. **Management, Culture:** Software developer here, heard a lot about good work culture and ability of management to pivot. Hastings has a co-CEO now and he himself is looking at longer term strategy.

Bears:

1. **Competitive, Saturated market:** US market base, pretty saturated. Worldwide, China is off limits, India is highly competitive. I am not sure where the growth in subscribers is going to come from?
2. **Price:** Due to increased competition, its hard to increase subscription price with low elasticity. 
3. **Cash Burn**: Huge production costs stretch the balance sheet. Likely to loose competitiveness if Netflix doesn't invest in home grown content (increased competition -&gt; less bargaining power). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**: Unsure if this is a long term hold. i think the price is gonna drop due to missed targets in subscriber base, maybe?

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I closed up some positions Thursday before close and raised cash which gave me an opportunity to open new positions when some good entries came about Friday on the dip. Still about 40% cash and will look to enter some trades on Tuesday.  


Positions that remain from previous weeks: **COTY, FEYE, GME, JMIA, PLTR**.  
Positions I opened Friday: **CRSR, RKT**

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&amp;#x200B;

**CRSR ($38)**

[CRSR chart](https://imgur.com/52ZHUcf)

This ticker finds it's way on my short-list of stocks once again. The channel it's trading in is pretty clear and each break-out at the $42 level gets rejected. If we continue to go down expect some support at $35.50. IMO I don't think it will break through for it to become a downward trend. I'm comfortable selling puts at $35 for February 15 going into the earnings report around then.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $35 strike puts sold to open for $3.30 or $330 premium. Return: 10%.  
**Break-even:** I lose if share price goes below $31.70 (20% drop from current level) by expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

**APPS ($56)**

[APPS chart](https://imgur.com/K8fnWOS)

APPS nearing the mid-way point of the strong upward channel it's been in. I wouldn't be surprised if it begins to trade sideways and consolidates after the share price doubled since November. Earnings are also coming up relatively soon. I will sell the put the week after earnings anticipating a period of consolidation and sideways action before the next move higher and maybe a run going into earnings day.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 7.5%  
**Break-even:** $46.25

&amp;#x200B;

**PINS ($69)**

[PINS chart](https://imgur.com/D4gScC1)

Finally an entry point into PINS. This ticker really took off over last summer and into the fall, but since December it's been pretty flat. It's right on the $70 level of supp/resistance. If this level breaks down we could see it go back to $65 area. I'll be confident selling my puts at $66 for the week after earnings in mid February. This will give me plenty of time should the stock consolidate or if we get one more push higher going into earnings.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $65 strike puts sold to open for $5.40 or $540 premium. Return: 8.5%.  
**Break-even:** $59.50

&amp;#x200B;

**DKNG ($53)**

[DKNG chart](https://imgur.com/DExQG41)

DKNG isn't my favorite to sell puts on because IV isn't as high for the return I could get, but it's been fairly reliable in terms of how it trades. Trend lines on this chart are going back to May instead of just the last 2-3 months. Like clockwork it's stayed within the channel for several 6 now. It is at the top of the channel, but could be due for a breakout if it follows the lead of PENN. Government will be looking for revenues and one of the easiest ways to do this moving forward will be to legalize sports-betting everywhere they can and tax the hell out of it. I am bullish long-term on this industry and really don't mind being assigned shares. I might sell closer to ATM puts here 5 weeks out and try to get an extra kick in premium.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $2.65 or $265. Return: 5.3%.  
**Break-even:** $47.35

&amp;#x200B;

**SNOW ($290)**

[SNOW chart](https://imgur.com/1QC1mJ8)

I always liked SNOW, but never got in due to concerns of valuation. For the price action it was experiencing post IPO it also never really had enticing IVs to sell puts against either, which was somewhat strange. Now that the swings in share price the stock is experiencing are narrowing IMO it could be a good time to sell puts with a long-term mindset. This would enable me to get in on some shares at a good price should I be assigned.

  
**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $275 strike put sold to open for $17.00 or $1,700 premium. Return: 6.2%

Jamf competes in the mobile device management (MDM) and enterprise mobility management industries (EMM). Jamf has a small number of competitors like [Apple’s Profile Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/profile-manager/intro-to-profile-manager-pm9cz84lqi/mac) and [Mosyle](https://mosyle.com/). One notable point is that Apple uses Jamf instead of its own in-house product. I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple has tried or will try to acquire Jamf. At the same time, I’m not sure if Apple (a $1tn+ company) will try to go after this industry. I believe Jamf has a good set of competitive advantages that will ward off competition and Apple.

What is mobile device management and enterprise mobility management? These terms are about securing the information and data on employees’ corporate or personal devices. If I’m using a corporate device, my employer is most likely using some software to make sure no information gets hacked into or stolen.

In the simplest terms, Jamf helps to protect its customers’ information and manage devices remotely. Jamf focuses on Apple devices. That’s their specialty. Other companies offer similar services but focus on providing that one service across Windows and Apple devices whereas Jamf focuses on providing many services to only Apple devices. 

**Business Overview**

Founded in 2002 by Zach Halmstad, Christopher Thon, and Chip Pearson, Jamf provides mobile device management software to its customers. The current CEO, Dean Hager, took over in 2015 and replaced Halmstad and Pearson. Vista Equity Partners acquired a majority of Jamf’s shares in December 2017 and still holds a majority stake today.

Jamf helps its customers manage Apple devices, products, or other Apple-related software/hardware. Employers that manage these resources want employees to have a secure Apple device that can be tracked and managed remotely.

At the end of Q3 (September 2020), Jamf had more than 43,000 customers with more than 18.6 million Apple devices. Jamf relies on a typical SaaS model to collect revenue. Jamf has customers ranging from Apple itself to 7 of the top 10 Fortune 500 technology companies, 24 of the 25 most valuable brands, and the 10 largest U.S. banks.

**Products**

Many of Jamf’s products match the same services as other public tech companies. For example, Crowdstrike provides Endpoint Protection, but Jamf Protect provides these same services but specific to Apple devices. Jamf continues to add new product offerings and expand into different industries.

Jamf has 5 main products, [Jamf Connect](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-connect/), [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-pro/), [Jamf Now](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/), [Jamf School](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-school/), and [Jamf Protect](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-protect/). The image in the article (can't fit the article into this post) provides a good comparison between Jamf’s offerings for the Apple vertical and the horizontal providers. I won’t be going into detail on these specific horizontal use cases. Jamf’s bread and butter is Jamf Pro, which accounted for 78% of total revenue in 2019.

Why would customers choose Jamf over Crowdstrike, Okta, or other horizontal providers? Jamf provides solutions specific to Apple devices rather than trying to solve problems for both Apple and Windows devices. For example, Apple devices have different security risks and weaknesses than Windows laptops so a horizontal solution such as Crowdstrike may not be the best solution for a company looking to manage a fleet of Apple devices. These solutions are managed remotely.

**Total Addressable Market**

Management states the global total addressable market for Apple Enterprise Management is $10.3 billion. Different independent research firms believe that this industry will also grow to $23.4 billion by 2024.

Although I like to gauge the TAM from different sources, anyone can google this information and find it out. There is no “edge” in investing like this. The way I’d think about this is what percentage of enterprise customers and their employees will have Apple devices that may need to be managed through Jamf. For example, will employees have an iPhone dedicated only to work? What about a laptop or a desktop computer? Throw in an iPad? Now, what’s the realistic average number of Apple devices for employees multiplied by the average cost per device to get an estimate of the TAM. Where else can Jamf expand? Into schools? Check. But what’s next. I’m not sure but I bet there’s some room for growth out there.

Secondly, although the number of Apple devices in businesses may be small today, what will this look like in the future? Will more companies be giving their employees an option between Apple and Windows? Jamf’s management team believes so. Are more people fans of Apple or Windows devices?

So although you may initially say that Windows will always be the main OS, a Jamf chart says otherwise ([Link - Q3 Investor Presentation](https://ir.jamf.com/static-files/5f5bbdf0-e77c-4172-bef6-bc289162e9f5) on page 6). If you’re in finance, you may never use an Apple device simply due to your reliance on Excel and other finance shortcuts, but other industries may not have this reliance on Windows computers.

**Competitive Advantages**

I believe Jamf has a number of competitive advantages.

* **Jamf Nation**
   * [Jamf Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/) is the largest online community of Apple IT administrators in the world. There are more than 100,000+ members. If a customer has a question, they can visit Jamf Nation and search to find an answer or ask the question themselves. This is basically a subreddit specific to Apple IT administrators looking for answers.
   * The scale of this community gives Jamf a competitive advantage because when competitors’ customers have questions, they won’t have such a large community of people that can help them answer questions.
* **Jamf Marketplace**
   * [Jamf Marketplace](https://www.jamf.com/community/marketplace/) allows customers to integrate with other tools and extend the reach of Jamf’s platform. As Jamf grows in size and develops relationships with more companies and grows the list of integrations, smaller companies will be unable to match the number of integrations that Jamf Marketplace offers.
* **Economies of Scale**
   * Jamf was founded in 2002 and since then has focused on providing a suite of solutions specific to Apple devices. No other company has come close, including Apple. As the leading company providing solutions for companies with Apple devices, Jamf has developed products built on its focus on Apple. This expertise of Apple spans the suite of products and gives Jamf a competitive advantage through economies of scale. Competitors are unable to replicate Jamf’s offerings in a timely manner. Jamf sells software. Software is a “build once, sell twice” type of product, meaning it gives Jamf incremental margin for each customer and Apple device it captures.
   * As Jamf grows in size, it will build products faster than smaller companies. Jamf will bundle different products into one offering to competitors at a lower price which will keep competition away. For example, wrapping together Jamf Connect, Jamf Pro, and Jamf Now for a hypothetical $20 per Apple device meanwhile a smaller company can only offer the equivalent of Jamf Pro for $15 per Apple device. This obviously makes Jamf’s proposition more appealing. Although costs aren’t everything, Jamf does benefit from its size giving it a possible advantage in the quality column.

**Financials**

Another tech company with strong growth. Let’s check out the numbers.

**2019:**

* Total revenue = $204 million
* Subscription revenue = $159 million
* Subscription revenue growth = 59%
* Subscription gross profit margin = 80%
* GAAP EBIT margin = -10%
* Annual recurring revenue = $209 million
* Dollar-based net retention rate = 118%

**2018:**

* Total revenue = $147 million
* Subscription revenue = $100 million
* Subscription gross profit margin = 76%
* GAAP EBIT margin = -20%
* Annual recurring revenue = $142 million
* Dollar-based net retention rate = 117%

Jamf doesn’t give financial numbers before December 2018. The most attractive part of Jamf is the subscription revenue that grew more than 59% from 2018 to 2019. This comes with high gross margins and depending on your outlook is likely to continue growing for some time.

Jamf has yet to release its 2020 annual earnings, but it expects total revenue of $263 million for the year ended December 2020.

**What’s Interesting**

* **Undervalued relative to other high growth tech companies?**
   * Jamf has a market cap of \~$3.9 billion at the time of writing this. Considering Jamf expects total revenue of $263 million and assuming it grows \~30% to $340 million. $3.9 billion / $340 million = 11.5x P/S multiple. Although valuation isn’t this easy (I wish it was) this seems rather cheap relative to other tech companies.
   * This shouldn’t be a basis for your investment though, but what makes Jamf relatively undervalued to its peers?
* **Riding Apple’s tailcoats.**
   * Apple is one of if not the strongest brand in the world. Everyone knows Apple. Jamf is helping businesses manage Apple devices safely, securely, and remotely. Jamf can ride Apple’s tailcoats and become a much larger company.
   * As businesses bring Apple devices into the work environment, Jamf will stand to benefit as the leading company that helps to manage these devices.

**Future Questions**

* **Do more enterprise customers offer employees the choice of Apple devices?**
   * As someone in finance, I rely on a Windows computer mostly for excel and other shortcuts, but are other industries as reliant on Windows? Oftentimes I prefer using an Apple device for the sleekness and the connection with other Apple products like Airpods, my iPhone, and much more, but can Apple extend beyond consumer products into enterprise products? I’m sure they have to some degree, but how common are Apple devices in the workplace and will they become more common/less common/or the same frequency?
* **What about Apple?**
   * The biggest risk to Jamf is arguably their relationship/competition with Apple. Apple has similar in-house products that are competitors to Jamf, but Apple hasn’t seen much success with this. Apple relies on Jamf for its own employees.
   * Does Apple try to compete with Jamf more head-on and build out the offerings to become more competitive? I’m not sure, but this is a small market relative to the size of Apple, and not sure if it’s worth Apple going after. Apple has its hands in a number of different industries like health and fitness, music and podcasts, and now Apple chips.

**Conclusion**

Jamf looks to be a great company that may benefit from Apple’s success. It will be interesting to see where Jamf is in 3+ years. I think this will be a successful company and given its small size ($3.9 billion), I can see this company being a multi-bagger one day.

There are still some key questions that need to be answered and my goal is only to provide you with a shallow dive that touches on the basic background of Jamf and any key questions that you may need to have in mind when doing your own research.",StockMarket,Jamf Analysis (NASDAQ: JAMF),https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kzzvi9/jamf_analysis_nasdaq_jamf/,True,submission

But recently the stock surged 100% in 2 days following announcements of new additions to the company’s board of directors.

**MY FAVORITE: ATNX, BTG, FSLR, KPTI, VRSN, WDAY, YEXT**

&amp;#x200B;

AKTS - Very similar set up to AEYE. Just retesting the 50EMA line, support, and channel up line. Indicators are fair, but Stoch is low. Good setup, not great.

[https://tos.mx/q6XhiSu](https://tos.mx/q6XhiSu)

&amp;#x200B;

ATNX - Fantastic channel play. Headed up from ground 0, which I love. Indicators are fair, but that makes sense with it running up. This is the first pullback of a run up.

[https://tos.mx/OiaYI6w](https://tos.mx/OiaYI6w)

&amp;#x200B;

AXU  - Great channel play, but we are not at not at perfect value. I want to see it get a tad bit lower before we really buy in. But indicators look good for a reversal eventually.

[https://tos.mx/167d4xB](https://tos.mx/167d4xB)

&amp;#x200B;

BTG - Fantastic setup here. Stock is about to start consolidating, and then take off eventually. Indicators look great, it just needs to show life.

[https://tos.mx/UXO4TzJ](https://tos.mx/UXO4TzJ)

&amp;#x200B;

C - Like AEYE and AKTS, a little overbought. Retesting 50EMA and channel support. Indicators are low, but is this consistent; no. So lets see if it can do it one more time.

[https://tos.mx/WYgvQhE](https://tos.mx/WYgvQhE)

&amp;#x200B;

CP   - Great run up, but earnings are coming. 50EMA bounce, over support. Great setup, but this is not sustainable; and earnings are coming soon. RSI is only fair.

[https://tos.mx/uEg8Z92](https://tos.mx/uEg8Z92)

&amp;#x200B;

EDU  - Fantastic run up and channel up play. It would be perfect, if it were down to $166. It is still at a good value, but it isn't perfect yet. Indicators are just fair.

[https://tos.mx/mggIMnW](https://tos.mx/mggIMnW)

&amp;#x200B;

FIVN - Good channel up again. 50EMA bounce, again the support is far away so it is more risk. It is a good setup, but not sustainable. Will we get one more push, hopefully. 

[https://tos.mx/W5u0Tjt](https://tos.mx/W5u0Tjt)

&amp;#x200B;

FSLR - Fantastic channel up, everything is there. Channel Support, Support, 200EMA line, and Indicators are perfect. This is a 10/10 play if it shows life Tuesday.

[https://tos.mx/SfBZSJs](https://tos.mx/SfBZSJs)

&amp;#x200B;

KPTI - Gorgeous channel here. Higher lows, massive potential, and it is a fantastic setup. Indicators all low and it is rolling beautifully. 

[https://tos.mx/hM0oRc3](https://tos.mx/hM0oRc3)

&amp;#x200B;

MSON - Good channel but not at best value, but a good setup. I want it to be close to $11. But it did gap down, so that gap will want to be filled eventually.

[https://tos.mx/VU5I2mS](https://tos.mx/VU5I2mS)

&amp;#x200B;

MTNB - Great ascending triangle but overbought. The stop lose makes it a lot of risk, and it is already overbought. Good setup, but it is still a bit risky.

[https://tos.mx/osnVCmI](https://tos.mx/osnVCmI)

&amp;#x200B;

SDC  - Great channel up again, but I want it closer to $10.50 right now. It is looking strong and has room to run, but it just needs a tad more value. All indicators show a reversal.

[https://tos.mx/YDVwTtZ](https://tos.mx/YDVwTtZ)

&amp;#x200B;

TTMI - Channel up off the 50EMA line, but it is now sustainable. Let's see if it keeps showing some life from here. Indicators say it should reverse but it is so overbought.

[https://tos.mx/U4KDccM](https://tos.mx/U4KDccM)

&amp;#x200B;

VEEV - Great channel, but once again not at my perfect area of value. I want $257. Indicators look pretty great, and a reversal is coming, may be here but I wish it was lower.

[https://tos.mx/62B3O6k](https://tos.mx/62B3O6k)

&amp;#x200B;

VMW  - Great area of value, but is it going to reverse here or drop more? Over reaction from a new CEO, so I think it has great life but not the best price or reward.

[https://tos.mx/hN02c3D](https://tos.mx/hN02c3D)

&amp;#x200B;

VRSN - Great deal, fantastic area of value. All indicators look good, and this is a great channel play. Fantastic play.

[https://tos.mx/wpcXRLY](https://tos.mx/wpcXRLY)

&amp;#x200B;

WDAY - Fantastic channel up. 200EMA bounce, support is close behind as well. Indicators look great. Ascending Triangle is forming.

[https://tos.mx/gDzjuAA](https://tos.mx/gDzjuAA)

&amp;#x200B;

YEXT - Bottom of channel now moving up. Great reward, low risk, ascending triangle forming. Indicators look good, this is a great setup.

And then I can day trade tomorrow.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

For example, This is RIGHT  
Day 1 BUY 100 shares of abc stocks (equal most balance)  
Then hold overnight  
Day 2 SELL 100 shares of abc stocks  
Day 3 BUY and SELL several times of ABC stock

This is WRONG  
Day 1 BUY 100 shares of abc stocks (equal most balance)  
Then hold overnight  
Day 2 SELL 100 shares of abc stocks, then BUY and SELL several times of abc stock in that day

This has caused speculation that ford will buy out MVIS. At least that’s what I’m thinking the catalyst is, because people can’t seem to come up with any other news to justify this huge rally. Ford has 29.5 b in cash, so they could buy MVIS and their 730 Million mkt cap if they wanted to, right?

...But would they? Ford has 157 billion in debt, and a 474% debt to equity ratio, which is high. This ratio has also increased 458% to 474% in the past 5 years. Does buying out MVIS seem like a good financial decision for them? They could use their LiDAR tech in their electric vehicle models, but electric vehicles are still a small fraction of total car sales, though they should see a big boost in 2021.

If they don’t get acquired, MVIS is basically screwed, they have only 7 million in revenue, less than 1 year in cash runway, and negative shareholder equity (its liabilities exceed its assets). Since the beginning of the year earnings have increased from -26 million a year to -13 million a year, primarily due to decreasing operating expenses, but revenue has decreased from 8.88 mil a year to 7.3 mil a year. On average earnings have declined by 9.9% per year for the past 5 years, its revenue has been up and down over the years, but is down from 5 years ago, when I reported 9.2 mil for Q4 2015.

This 83% gain we’ve seen for MVIS in this past week seems like a lot for just the news that someone who used to work at Ford now works at MVIS’s board. I think it could have been boosted by attention gained through Citron research’s attention towards the LiDAR tech sector. LAZR has had an incredible run, but after famous short seller Citron wrote a hit piece on it, it brought all eyes that weren’t already on LAZR and it’s rally, straight to it.

Also, while I was checking the price of LAZR at times like 4AM, I was using webull, because imo it’s the best platform to check stocks in early premarket. In the webull comments section under LAZR, I saw a lot of people telling the LAZR holders who were watching their stock plummet to “bring it on over to $MVIS”, since they both make LiDAR technology. This makes me think that all the hype around LAZR could have rubbed off on MVIS and boosted it. It isn’t a particularly hard stock to pump either, with an extremely small mkt cap of around 350 million at the beginning of December. Now it’s at 730 mil and I’m wondering if a simple rumor bringing it this far is unwarranted, and if I should get puts. I mean seriously, there is no other news around this thing. It struck a deal with Microsoft back in 2019 to develop the hololens 2, which you can check out at r/hololens. It’s just a virtual reality device used for productivity in the workplace that costs $3500. It’s function does look really cool and futuristic.

Ansys is a simulation software company used to simulate multi-physic systems including ADAS systems.”

Also:

“Across message boards, investors have been suggesting that Curran still works at Ford. While she left her position at Ford two years ago, the connection is important. There’s no doubt that Curran has friends that serve as executives at Ford”

I found the above quote from an article found from a post on r/MVIS : [MVIS Stock: Will Ford Acquire MicroVision?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/kcxva6/mvis_stock_will_ford_acquire_microvision/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb) from the comments section, it appears that the article was written by an author who was originally under the impression that Curran currently worked at Ford: 

“Unfortunately, the main premise of this article is that Judy currently works for Ford. She left Ford 2 years ago.”

“I contacted the author of this article and he apologized for the error. He did not verify information provided by one of his readers. He has already corrected the article.”

And yes, MVIS has its own subreddit, and they seem to be a very close community, some calling each other by their real names. I read a post about someone inviting everyone on the sub to a bar to get a drink on him, and another post about a 29 year old who cried because he saw his account hit 6 figures. Some of these people seem to have been bag holding since 2000 at the peak of the .com bubble, when MVIS was trading at over $500 a share, and they talk about how long they’ve waited for this moment.

I’ve had [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) Reddit post brought to my attention as “excellent DD” about MVIS and it’s huge future, let’s see what they have to say:

“MVIS explicitly claims that it will offer such a better and cheaper lidar product in 4 months time (April 2021), one which can enter mass production 7-9 month from today (Q3 2021).

If this is true, what would prevent MVIS (or its buyer) from claiming the entire market, other than an even better product emerging from elsewhere?”

That “elsewhere” already exists, and it wasn’t mentioned one time in that entire post. Velodyne Lidar (VLDR)

“Its products are used in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, ADAS, UAVs, mapping, industrial automation, self-driving rovers, autonomous vessels, smart city initiatives, and robotics.” - SimplyWall St

It has a 45% forecast annual revenue growth, 74% forecast earnings growth, forecast to become profitable in the next 3 years, has only 10 million in debt, but it has been decreasing its revenue and earnings for the past 2 years. Company data starts in 2018 with 182m/yr and decreased to 101m/yr on December 30 2019. They do have enough cash runway for more than 3 years based on its current free cash flow. 8 bil mkt cap &amp; industry leader, Citron also recommended VLDR over LAZR. [forecasts](https://imgur.com/gallery/3XuMEnA) - [history](https://imgur.com/gallery/NCPWEVq)

On MVIS, the lack of news, the misinformation having been spread by “message boards”, the terrible fundamentals/financials, the small market cap, the Citron hype, and the webull comments with 14 upvotes encouraging regretful LAZR investors to switch on over to MVIS — to me, an unexperienced investor who only got into stocks in January, this has pump and dump written all over it. What do some of the more experienced investors on here think? I mean, self driving cars *are* the future, and EV’s *are* getting a lot of attention right now, maybe it’s on track to have an amazing 2021 despite no deals with automakers yet? Would an automaker even benefit from acquiring this company and all its liabilities rather than just buy its sensors from LAZR or VLDR?

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions right now, I made a quick buck off of calls buying on Monday and selling on Tuesday because I was seeing those comments and the increasing momentum on MVIS. I am considering puts, especially if this thing goes up any higher, but it feels like a bold move, and I want others opinions.

And that’s where the original post ended, but after investigating further, I’ve found a couple things:

There is no news because the news is classified. The military is ordering IVAS goggles from MSFT, but it isn’t officially disclosed that MVIS’s tech was used here. But [investigations ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k5r92b/is_hololens_2_ivas_using_a_tiled_display/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)on the r/mvis sub have speculated that they are involved in the development of this technology, and will receive an unspecified amount in royalties. This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k6ujtg/lawmakers_reduce_ivas_funding_in_final_defense/genx7yt/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;context=3) took a guess at what it was, and came up with 16 million in revenue/yr, which would be a nice increase from its current 7. The bill was passed Dec. 8 that authorized [670 Million](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k9ge4v/defense_bill_clears_house_with_vetoproof_majority/gf4m7e9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;context=3) to spend on these IVAS goggles. 


4 days later, you get this [tweet](https://twitter.com/insideralerts4u/status/1337641428571328513?s=21): 

“Name and Address of Reporting Person: Farhi Yalon

Securities Acquired (A) or Disposed Of (D)
Amount: 67,289    (A) or (D): D     Price: $2.6

Transaction Date: 12/10/2020”

A quick google of “Fargo Yalon” brings [this](https://wallmine.com/people/15804/yalon-farhi): 

“How old is Yalon Farhi?

Yalon Farhi is 58, he's been the Director of Microvision since 2016. There are 4 older and 3 younger executives at Microvision. The oldest executive at Microvision Inc. is Bernee Strom, 72, who is the Independent Director.”


So, the director of Microvision decided to dump $78,000 worth of his stock, two days after congress approved 670 million worth of military spending on a product that they will supposedly get royalties for. Now why in the world would he do that?


But wait, there’s more! 

On November 30th, the day before it was announced that Judy Curran is joining the board, we get [this](https://twitter.com/insideralerts4u/status/1333899284094332930?s=21) insider filling from the woman herself:

“Name of Reporting Person: Curran Judith Mecham

Title of Derivative Security: Option (right to buy)

Conversion or Exercise Price of Derivative Security: $2.31
Transaction Date: 11/30/2020
Number of Derivative Securities Acquired (A) or Disposed of (D): A: 15,000
Expiration Date: 11/30/2030
Price of Derivative Security: $0”

Now there’s actually two of these orders, one is executable 11/30/2021 and one is executable 11/30/2020, I don’t know what this can tell us about Judith’s intentions, but someone can probably help out. Also, what is the strike, 2.31? Why doesn’t she believe it can go higher than that? Also, holy shit what kind of back to the future ass leaps are those. Elon Musk doesn’t even like Lidar, says [“Anyone who relies on LIDAR is doomed”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/05/06/elon-musks-war-on-lidar-who-is-right-and-why-do-they-think-that/?sh=281e1b372a3b), who knows if it’ll be around by then. And I don’t understand what “Price of Derivative Security” means, but I wanna know the price of this option, because she’s shelling out for 10 years of theta. And buying 15 thousand of them. No actually 30 thousand. Her 30,000 calls getting covered must be the cause of this spike in price, right? Why did the majority of the movement happen December 11-18th, 11 days after her purchase? I don’t know how this kind of stuff works, do they usually wait a couple days? I heard people who sell calls have to cover by 20% to avoid gamma or some shit. I tried asking about this on r/options but they told me to google it.

Anyway

Her 30,000 contract contracts give her the right to buy.... 3 million shares of MVIS at $2.31 a share. 6 million times 2.31 = about $7 million in shares. The stock has moved 380 mill in market cap, so she can’t have moved it by herself, but she probably helped. What do you guys think. I haven’t looked into whether that military visor actually uses MVIS’s tech but it seems very likely considering MSFT’s connection with MVIS and how sure they seemed on r/MVIS. I need y’all’s help to fit the pieces of the puzzle together though because I’ve only been investing for less than a year.

To me, the insiders show some confidence in the crazy expiration date, suggesting they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, even though a recession could probably wipe them out with their cash runway that wouldn’t last them a year. They also show some fear because the director sold $78,000 worth of shares days after their military contract was confirmed. It should be noted that originally the military was supposed to spend over 900 million on IVAS goggles but they settled for 670 million. It should not affect forecast earnings/revenue though, because it’s basically a secret that they even have anything to do with that.",StockMarket,MVIS: Fragile Future or 2030 Lidar Leader?,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kfjodj/mvis_fragile_future_or_2030_lidar_leader/,True,submission

I recently got into investing in stocks. I was just buying stable stocks with good long term outlook and thinking to hold them for longer durations. 

I want to trade a little bit to get a feel for the market.

I was reading some news articles the other day and they say that no of chronic illnesses like cancer have been very low this year. Reason is that people are not going to hospitals and are not getting checked as often as they did the previous years. From people around me and the stories I hear, it seems true. Also, with less exposure to outside environment, the accidents and contaminations would be very low too(need to look at official statistics to confirm this). So, apart from Covid, the instances of other diseases are a little lower this year.

So I am thinking since so many pharma stocks are piggybacking on the pharma hype and are highly priced right now, while in fact only very few companies are selling Covid related medicines to actually make a profit, would pharma stocks fall by next year?  Should we short them?

Is this how we need to think before trading. Get an intuition and verify with stats and reports? How do you find a ""play"" and what would you do to believe in it, I mean, how would you verify it?

FedEx crushed earnings but still dropped as investors looked for guidance. What to expect from Nike after the close? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw another great day for the stock market with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vQZKh9Y) leading the way up 0.84%, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r2K5TXj) also up 0.58% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/j5MYhLG) up almost half a percent, as all 3 big indexes closed at new a record high. We also saw de [VIX](https://ibb.co/P6dnhX7) dropping below 22, as it dropped 2.5%.

Almost 2/3 of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SsV2KG6) were advancing yesterday with over 200 new highs on average volume, as 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yhc1562) in the SP500 were in the green with only energy and communications losing ground for the day, as small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g7zCvs9) while large-caps were flat for the day.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/bdFGb96) that yesterday was a good day for most of the stock market, while only a couple of companies lost significant ground like Boeing, AT&amp;T and Google, while Tesla rose again ahead of the SP500 inclusion.

Important economic data also came in, as initial jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/dJQv6d0) rose even more from the previous week by more than 20k, while the continuing jobless claims fell to 5.5M, lower than expected and the last week number. I think it is possible we can see the initial claims jump to over 900K in the next weeks as the economy feels more pressure from the rising cases numbers and more restrictions.

Meanwhile, we also got the December Kansas City FED [INDEX](https://ibb.co/L6zW9Zp) reading, that came in at +14, above the estimates and the numbers from November. But this is still more than 10 points down from last year’s reading, while the Philly Fed [outlook](https://ibb.co/LJwCCpT) came in worse than expected and last month’s reading.

We also got numbers from November housing [starts](https://ibb.co/jvcyWyV), as this came in with a more than 1% increase month over month, bigger than expected, as building permits also jumped more than 6% to over 1.6M.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2hMmxy3) there is not a lot of important economic data that will come in, as the outlook for the economy remains very uncertain at the moment, as the economy needs to survive until enough people get the shot so we can reach herd immunity, which will allow business to come back again, as restrictions will go away.

We also saw Moderna receive the [FDA](https://ibb.co/fqC4Qys) Ad Com endorse the vaccine with a 20 to 0 vote and 1 abstention.

So, today is a big day, today is quadruple witching day and also the last day that Tesla is not included in the SP500. It’s [expected](https://ibb.co/ZVQ9MRR) that there will be over $80B worth of shares trading hands today, as they will become the most valuable company ever to enter the main index on Wall Street. This will also force index-tracking funds and money managers to buy Tesla shares to correctly reflect the index, while also selling positions in other companies that are part of the SP, as Tesla will account for over 1% of the index starting Monday.

Meanwhile, the company also just received an [upgrade](https://ibb.co/mHnpZHb) on its crediting rating from S&amp;P Global ratings as they noted that Tesla’s net debt is essentially zero based on key metric, DEBT to EBITDA.

So, expect some massive volume to be traded in Tesla in the final minutes before the close today, Tesla is already the most traded [stock](https://ibb.co/1XZ58xj) on Wall Street and has surged more than 50% since the SP news came out. I think either outcome is possible as we can see either the stock heading to new highs or see a decent correction if bears prevail. Just watch out for the closing of the session today.

This is will be key moment for the stock market, with the FED also coming out today with the latest round of stress [tests](https://ibb.co/26CZDCh) for the banks. I don’t expect any surprises coming from here, as they were found to be able to weather big capital losses last time around in the summer.

In some other stock market news, [FedEx](https://ibb.co/ZVmggDG) delivered great earnings results, delivering a beat of more than 80 cents on EPS, while it also saw a bigger increase in revenue than expected, with a more than $1B beat and the operating margin coming in pretty much as expected.

The net income and earnings per share more than [doubled](https://ibb.co/vV7FTbv) since last year after rate hikes and spiking volume from e-commerce shipments, as the company has seen a boom alongside the e-commerce growth. But this was not enough to help the stock, as it dropped 3% in after-hours, as the lack of a formal guidance kind of disappointed investors, as they did not offer an improved [outlook](https://ibb.co/C1LFVDf) for FY2021 and the capital spending is still expected to surpass $5B.

While today we also get [Nike](https://ibb.co/s15BfJH) earnings after the close, as the company is expected to have a lower EPS than last year, but to increase the revenues by more than 1%. Nike is a great company and the world largest sportswear company, and I expect them to deliver on these expectations as its digital strategy is offsetting much of the lost retail sales after massive investments in technology that are transforming its business.

Some expected [news](https://ibb.co/qMs6xv5) also came in from Coca-Cola as they will cut more than 1K jobs in the US and more than 2K worldwide. This is another move that is looking to improve the efficiency of the company, as they have been hit alongside the restaurant business.

While Doordash fell [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LCdsSN1), after the short sellers from citron research called it the most ridiculous IPO of the year, giving the company a Price Target of $40. I usually don’t agree with such drops after short sellers make some statements or publish something, this is a common-used tactic by them, they get into a stock and publish a report that sees the stock plunge as the make money. But I kind of have to agree with them on this one, the valuation for Doordash is just ridiculous, but I don’t see it going down that much…

In comparison, investors seem to like [ABNB](https://ibb.co/F47f56X) somewhat more than DASH, as AirBNB traded higher, but still has a ridiculous valuation, bigger the BP, FedEx or even Deere, despite negative margins with more competition and new lawsuits from different cities in the world.

JPMorgan Chase announced in the minutes after the Fed’s test results that its board had approved a new share repurchase program of $30 billion.

Stocks fell Friday, one day after the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recorded new intraday highs. Market participants were disappointed by the weekly unemployment report, which unexpectedly saw new jobless claims rise to the highest level since September, but remain hopeful the grim data will compel lawmakers to pass more virus-related stimulus. 

This Friday marked a quarterly event known as the quadruple witching, during which stock index futures and options, and single equity futures and options, all expire on the same day. This tends to cause trading volumes to spike. This S&amp;P 500 is also set for a major rebalance with the index set to include Tesla, the largest company ever to be added by market cap, in the index by Monday, December 21.

On Thursday, the Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims, much higher than the 818,000 expected. The increase in unemployment is likely a result of the new restrictions being placed throughout the country in response to the recent surge in coronavirus. 

Despite optimistic words from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the possibility of a no-deal scenario and a partial government shutdown is still on the table. Senate Majority Whip John Thune suggested Thursday that the government could go into a partial shutdown over the weekend if lawmakers are unable to agree on the details of both the government spending bill and the virus-relief attached to it. Yesterday, McConnell said, “lawmakers made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief” and that “we \[Senators\] have agreed we will not leave town until we’ve made law.” Hopefully, lawmakers are finally able to come together and pass additional and much-needed economic relief.

In good news, more progress was made on the vaccine front after the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) advisory panel voted to recommend that Moderna’s (MRNA) coronavirus vaccine candidate be authorized for emergency use. This would be the second inoculation to be granted emergency use authorization in the US. Pfizer’s (PFE) vaccine has already begun to be distributed across the US.

# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 — a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.
*****
&gt; Even with this year’s sharp sell-off, the S&amp;P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.
*****
&gt; Those in CNBC’s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&amp;P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.
*****
&gt; Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.
*****
&gt; But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It’s nothing like what you saw in the spring,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. “It’s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.”
*****
&gt; Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.
*****
&gt; # The week ahead
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&amp;P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla’s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&amp;P on Monday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’ll see whether or not there’s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it’s absorbed within the S&amp;P,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&amp;P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.
*****
&gt; Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. “At this point, the vaccines are stimulus,” she said.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday’s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.
*****
&gt; Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.

&gt; # First-quarter speed bump
&gt; “The first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there’s the potential for some negative outlooks. “I think we’re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.” Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat’s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he’s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.
*****
&gt; There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it’s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.
*****
&gt; If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.
*****
&gt; “The January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it’s close. It’s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.
*****
&gt; “But I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it’s pretty clear you’re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don’t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,” said Bank of America’s Harris.
*****
&gt; Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.
*****
&gt; In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.
*****
&gt; “Given the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it’s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don’t have solid earnings streams.
*****
&gt; The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.
*****
&gt; He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.
*****
&gt; In the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.
*****
&gt; If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.
*****
&gt; “If you put stimulus like that into the economy that’s open, that’s a big boost,” Harris said.
*****
&gt; Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed’s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don’t.

&gt; # An Overbought World

&gt; The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Positive

&gt; Leading Economic Indicators for the month of November came in higher than expected this morning, rising 0.6% versus estimates for an increase of 0.5%. One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.

&gt; If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**

&gt; While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.

&gt; # Real Santa Claus Rally

&gt; Stock Trader’s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**

&gt; The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days

&gt; With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**

&gt; Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.

&gt; # Wretched Retail Sales

&gt; If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn’t enough, October’s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October’s report.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don’t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars &amp; Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics &amp; Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food &amp; Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online– all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**

&gt; The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Chart of the Year

&gt; Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. “One thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don’t bet against several more years of new highs.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We’ve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here’s the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&amp;P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.

Even if you buy at $11 or $12 your max loss would be 10 or 20%. 

Also there is the risk the spac goes nowhere for 2 years (at which your money will be returned to you) and you miss out on those potential gains.

Am I missing anything else here? 

I'm thinking of parking some extra cash in SPACs since I dont want to invest in regular stocks right now since I find 99% of the market to be current fair value or overvalued. Not many opportunities here. 

I also have a fairly large portfolio I've been adding to for the last 5 years I'm pretty happy with already that I am just holding long term.

I am investigating SNCR, a penny stock [recommended by YouTuber Joseph Hogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFewtI5P3x0&amp;t=325s).  The company works with financial technology, especially involving cloud  computing. The analysts report in TD Ameritrade (my brokerage) is that it will rise to between $6.50 and $9 by the end of 2021.

One issue that worries me, other than the normal volatility  of penny stocks, is the fact that the company is being [investigated for violations of the securities law](https://news.yahoo.com/sncr-investor-alert-bernstein-liebhard-140200373.html),  and it's CEO resigned. Also, the CEO, CTO, and CFO of the company seem  to have recently been selling some of their shares. Not a lot, but [their profiles on WallMine](https://wallmine.com/people/66798/jeffrey-george-miller)  seem to indicate that. Strangely, their amount of stock in the company  sometimes seem to grow after a sale. They also seem to be able to own  stock without buying it in the first place. I have no idea why that is.

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

Please let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottoms-Up Software Sales**

The ""bottoms up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottoms-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottoms-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottoms-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottoms-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

## What's so special about bottoms-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottoms-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottoms-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottoms-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottoms-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottoms-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottoms-up company

Not all bottoms-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottoms-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottoms-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottoms-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottoms-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottoms-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottoms-Up Companies

Below are some bottoms-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottoms-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottoms-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottoms-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottoms-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottoms-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

Below are some more bottoms-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Zoom ($ZM)
2. Atlassian ($TEAM)
3. Datadog ($DDOG)
4. Zendesk ($ZEN)
5. Hubspot ($HUBS)

Is a good strategy to invest during this period of time on stocks? Generally? Where I can find historic data about other companies before adding to Sp500? What I mean is the period since the news are announced until the day the stock enter in the sp500.

Stocks traded choppily today, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones finishing modestly red, despite more positive vaccine news from Pfizer (PFE).

This week, there has been great news on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, fueling optimism that the pandemic may be over in the coming months. Today, Pfizer announced it had concluded its Phase 3 trial and found its vaccine candidate to be 95% effective against COVID-19, up from the 90% effectiveness reported last week and roughly the same rate as the vaccine candidate Moderna (MRNA) is developing. According to the company, “Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics; observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%”. Pfizer said it now has the safety data required to submit for emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “within days” and plans to produce 50 million doses by the end of the year and 1 billion by the end of next year. However, it is important to remember that implementing a global distribution network for the vaccine will still take some time, even after approval is granted.

Recently, the market has experienced a rotation out of the previously high-flying tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks that were hit hard by the pandemic. The Russell 2000 index outperformed the market and jumped to a record-high. Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist for ProShares, expects market participants to continue to buy cyclical and reopening stocks that are cheap compared to before the pandemic.

Unfortunately, despite positive news on the vaccine front, coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket. In the United States, sadly the country recorded 1,707 coronavirus-related deaths, a new record since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. New daily cases and hospitalization are also at record-highs, with an average of 150,000 new cases per day and more than 73,000 people hospitalized nationwide. In response to the surge, governors from both sides of the political aisle have begun reintroducing restrictions to slow the spread. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. ""If Iowans don't buy into this, we'll lose,"" she said. ""Businesses will close once again, more schools will be forced to go online, and our health care system will fail.""

 The study of 560 healthy adults, including 240 over the age of 70-years-old, found the vaccine to be safe and produced a similar immune response among people aged over 56-years-old and those aged between 18 and 55.

* British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.
* The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection.
* The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.

 The preliminary findings of a phase two trial show that the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is safe and triggers a similar immune response among all adults.

The promising early-stage results were published in The Lancet, one of the world’s top medical journals, on Thursday.

The study of 560 healthy adults, including 240 over the age of 70-years-old, found the vaccine to be safe and produced a similar immune response among people aged over 56-years-old and those aged between 18 and 55.

 British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which is working in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has previously said interim data showed their experimental vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.

A safe and effective vaccine is seen by many as a game-changer in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of over 1.3 million people worldwide.

Huge challenges remain before a vaccine can be rolled out, however. The global battle to secure prospective supplies has raised alarm about equitable access, while questions remain over logistics, distribution, and cost.

The Oxford vaccine candidate was found to cause few side effects and triggered immune responses in both parts of the immune system in all age groups and at low and standard doses.

The preliminary results showed that the vaccine — ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 — prompted what’s known as a “T-cell response” within 14 days of the first dose, and an antibody response within 28 days of the booster dose. Scientists expect T-cell responses to play a role in long-term immunity against the virus.

Dr. Maheshi Ramasamy, a co-author of the study at the University of Oxford, said the antibody and T-cell responses among older adults were “robust” and “encouraging.”

“The populations at greatest risk of serious COVID-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults,” Ramasamy said.

“We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”

## Study limitations

The authors of the Oxford study said their results could be encouraging if the immune responses are found to be associated with protection against Covid-19 infection. The phase two trial did not assess vaccine efficacy, however, and phase three trials are ongoing to confirm this.

Results are expected later this year depending on the rate of infection within clinical trial communities.

The authors noted some limitations to their study, including that participants in the oldest age group had an average age of 73 to 74 and few underlying health conditions, and almost all participants were White and non-smokers.

People from a range of backgrounds, countries, and ethnicities were said to be included in the phase three trial.

The study comes days after two other vaccine makers announced encouraging results from phase three trials. They said their experimental vaccines were found to be highly effective in protecting against the coronavirus, boosting optimism at a time when health systems in Europe and the U.S. are once again being pushed to breaking point.

Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday a final analysis found their vaccine candidate was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 and appeared to fend off severe disease.

### Market Notes:

Yesterday near the end of the day sellers took over and the markets all ended in the red after spending most of the day in the green. This sell-off broke critical support levels.

I've been calling for a bull run into the end of the year but I could be wrong. I'm a trader at the end of the day. I create a theory and get paid when it's right. But I must always be prepared to be wrong.

Trading is not about being right. It's about being flexible and changing you're opinion when the situation changes.

Yet another vaccine is showing promising results this morning. And PFE's is better than first announced.

SPACs, EVs and green energy seem to be the hottest plays in the market right.

Futures are down this morning. I'll be a little more cautious today. I'm not here to be right, I'm here to make money.

This after the Mayor of New York announced that the city will once again switch schools to online due to them having reached a 3% testing positivity rate on a 7day moving average scale.

Over 60% of the companies were declining on below average volume yesterday as there might be some retracements to the 50 and 200-day moving averages as a lot of the stocks are trading quite high above them. Almost all sectors were in the red yesterday with energy and real estate being the most heavily hit by the increasing restrictions also there was no clear outperformer in large cap vs small caps though momentum and growth did a littler better than the value plays. The recent drops and stagnation in the stock market is likely due to investors not knowing what to focus on, as the vaccine news have been a great positive and will help the economy recover in the future but in the meantime the pandemic is raging on and the near term future is uncertain.

So after the close yesterday Nvidia announced a beat of 36 cents on the expectation with an EPS of 2,91$ which is a more than 1$ improvement since last year and a beat of over 300 million $ on revenue, which have seen a more than 50% increase since last year. Gaming revenues came in even better than expected at 2,27 billion$ while data center revenue also improved more than 160% year over year and also was better than expectations.

They also announced they will give out a dividend, it does have a small yield but it’s better than nothing and also gave guidance for next quarter that was 10% better than forecasted on revenue with the gross margin also expected to improve about 140 basis points.

Nvidia might get a boost soon as they have just refiled the merger notification for the ARM deal, if they do manage to acquire ARM, this will greatly improve the company’s outlook as it might propel them to join the tech trillion dollar valuation as the global gaming industry has spiked up almost 20% year over year and is expected to have a compound annual growth of almost 10% in the next years.

So I believe they are a great company to invest in for the future and you can buy this dip after the earnings because there was no week point in them, I would buy more of the company if the stock falls under 500$. [NVIDIA PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/1ntybNM)

Yesterday Apple also announced that they will cut the apple store tax in half to 15% for smaller developers starting next year. Though this impacts 98% of developers in the app store, it will only affect about 5% of the revenue so the impact on the EPS should be pretty small as Morgan Stanley only expects this to be a 3 cents per share down-risk for Apple. This action has been taken by the company to probably divide developers as they continue the legal battle with Epic Games. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/PMbFv3f) [APPLE IMPACT](https://ibb.co/TqsrSTc)

Also, two big retailers released earnings yesterday with Target delivering a solid beat of more than a dollar per share and a revenue beat of almost 2 billion $ with comparable sales almost doubling the expectations. They did not provide any guidance but a strong holiday season will likely see the company doing very well in the next quarter. The company saw a huge increase in both traditional store of 10% and a stunning 155% growth in online sales. This came alongside a 80 basis points increase in gross margin as well to top the expectations. This led the stock to gain more than 2% on a day when the stock market was trending down. [TGT DIGITAL SALES](https://ibb.co/Jtp0NV7) [TGT EPS](https://ibb.co/Hxd2NcD)

The other big retailer that released earnings was Lowe’s as the company just beat the expectations by 2 cents but delivered a better result on revenue while the comparable sales were up more than 30% and the online sales more than doubled for the company. This wasn’t enough for the stock to hold as it saw the price plunge by more than 8% on the day as investors were not impressed by the weak profit guidance for next quarter with an EPS between 1,10$ to 1,20$ versus the expectations of 1,17$. I don’t think was a good indicator for the company’s outlook and could be a great opportunity to buy the stock on the dip. [LOWES STATS](https://ibb.co/WsWrfZV) [LOWES EPS](https://ibb.co/Q6rtWZQ)

A quick though about the Tesla stock being added to the SP doesn’t add any significant value for the company but it is an important milestone as 51 billion $ worth of other SP500 position will be sold so that the company can be added to the  index fund. They are the biggest company ever to be added to the index. Tesla Is not a traditional car company, it’s a disruptive technology company on the EV front, that’s why its valuation is so high compared to other car makers like you can see in this report from Morgan Stanley as they raised the price target by almost 200$ to a price of 540$ for the stock. This is also helped by more and more countries imposing restrictions and announcing bans on traditional fossil fueled cars in the future.   [BRITAIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/CM4PmQ8) [MS Analysts](https://ibb.co/N2b2fdJ)

Other news came yesterday for companies like Shopify which will accept direct payments via Alipay which has more than 1 billion users in China which will improve the payment flow for companies that use the platform. [SHOPIFY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vZSDLNn)

While NIO gained target boost from multiple banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and others as they expect the company to be a long-term winner in the premium EV space and gain a significant market share in the next decade, the stock did fell on the report that Nikola and GM are close to finalizing the deal to manufacture the Nikola Badger as Nikola shares gained more than 15% on the day. [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/8XQLG85) [NIKOLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6gmZqXL)

Also, the controversial company Palantir secured another US army contract and saw it’s shares rise again to all time highs intra-day, as the company keeps getting the stamp of approval from the government with more and more contracts. [PALANTIR NEWS](https://ibb.co/GMpQWj0)

Google also seems to be jumping in the action for more and more online payments solutions as the company will allow users to open bank accounts through Google Pay. The accounts will not be charged monthly fees or require minimum balances which is pretty much in line with the other competitors aproach. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/tPXXmz0)

And one final though just like Bill Gates said yesterday, Zoom will continue be a great company to own, as they’re product is superior to competitors, business travel will never go back to what it was, this is happening while a lot of people are taking risks and dumping money in cruise lines stocks and restaurant stocks.

Ive been keeping my eye on this company for the last few months when I learned that they were partnering with EV companies...earnings were solid, stock price has been steadily going up on low volume the last few days, suddenly yesterday we had a high volume day. Also, there has been a steady stream of good news.

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, I am pretty bullish here after reading up on them and their future plans. Today I read that they are thinking about selling their intellectual property related to their smartphone business to focus soley on cyber security which would net them around half a billion if true. The CEO also seems like a pretty smart guy as he has worked to turn this company around. It sits at around a 50% institutional hold and the charts looking pretty nice lately.

It's earnings season! The banks kicked things off last week with mixed results. This week has a lot of big names reporting like **NFLX**, **LUV**, **TSLA** to name a few.

The election is just over two weeks away as we all look forward to seeing furniture commercials once again. 

No major news on either of those fronts right now. I'm keeping an eye on both these as the week progresses.

Futures are higher this morning the recent dip continues to get bought up. I still think new record highs are possible before the election.

Stocks traded higher today, with market participants hoping that lawmakers may succeed in coming to an agreement for more stimulus in the near-term. 

Stocks lost some momentum in the last hour of market, but still ended the day higher overall. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.21%, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.35% up.

Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a deadline for today to reach a deal with the Trump administration for an additional round of stimulus before the November election. However, in an interview today, Pelosi downplayed the importance of the deadline she had set, signaling that she is willing to keep talks going. “It isn’t that this day was a day that we would have a deal, it was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step. Hopefully by the end of the day today, we’ll know where we stand.” In other words, if a bill is to be voted on and passed before the November election, terms need to be agreed and the bill written soon.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama responded saying, “You never know what's going to happen around here at the last minute but it's getting to be toward the last minute and the clock keeps ticking away. I’m not optimistic about doing anything.”

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Pelosi are set to continue discussion regarding stimulus today at 3 p.m. easter time, as both officials make a push to come to an agreement very soon. Discussions between the pair have been ongoing for weeks but unfortunately very little progress seems to be made, grappling with disagreements on issues including state and local funding and liability protection, per the Wall Street Journal. Let’s hope they are able to come to a decision. 

Pres. Trump also supported the idea of a large, comprehensive stimulus package  saying “I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats. Not every Republican agrees, but they will. I want to do it even bigger, because this is money going to people who did not deserve what happened to them.""

**Highlights**

* The US Justice Department filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Google (GOOG) alleging that the company has unlawfully suppressed competition to maintain a monopoly in search engines by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels. Despite this, the stock was 1.79% up at the time of writing.

SPY / SPY Futures

Starting from the higher 1D timeframe we can see that price action has been finding support right on the 1D 21 (yellow line).  The last 3 candles all have touched the 1D 21 and bounced showing major support here. Additionally we can see that 4 out of the last 6 candles have major upside wicks showing some major sell pessure.  So there is definitely a bit of a war going on at the moment. 1D momentum oscillator's are also in a bearish posture. 

1D chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tDxBmexd/

On the 4 hour chart we can see major buying under the 4 hour 100 (teal line).  This buying has been taking place in the 341-342.50 area which we have identified as a supply zone.  In the screen shot you can see major wicks to the downside under the 4 hour 100 causing all 4 hour closes to be above this level.  The 21 and 55 EMA look likely to cross down in the next 24 hours as well.  I think its likely that price action gets up to the 4 hour 21 today and get rejected (but a break upwards would be a strong long signal.).  The 4 hour oscillator's are mid range and if anything a neutral / bearish.  Looknig at the 4 hour I think its likely we get a little bit of a bounce this morning. 

4h chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YaSHLSll/

On the 1 hour Chart we can see there has been a lot of action around the 3439 horizontal.  On the left size of the screen shot we can see the break of this area at the beginning of october lead to a nice run.  Then in mid Ocober this horizontal acted as major support that lead to another bounce back up to 350.  Now the last few days price action has been up and dowm over the horizontal multiple times, but oveall finding support.  1 Hour roscillator's are low in the range and crossing up giving a bullish signal at least for the next few hours.   Another important thing to look for on the 1 hour timeframe is the death cross of the 55 and 200 EMA (green and purple lines).  We can see the death cross occured on the 20th and was retested yesterday the 21st and rejected.  It is very common for the area of a death cross to get tested and act as resistance.  Though it looks like we are likely to get another test of the cross area today.  Watch to see if spy breaks through this area or breaks upwards. 

1 hour chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/IfxylVan/

My ovearll thoughts are simple.  If spy is able to break back above the highs of yesterday we will likely see the 350's again.  Though if spy breaks below 342 on a daily candle we likely see a major sell off potentially back int the 320's.  The 342.50 supply zone reminds me a lot of how price action acted around 320 a few weeks ago.  And we can see that at 320 there was a ton of buying that has lead to a huge bounce.  I am getting similar vibes from this area which leads me to believe that if 342 holds we could see new ATH's.  Though if it breaks probably back down to 320's.  Peronally I am leaning 60/40 to the downside in what I think will happen.",StockMarket,"I trade SPY options, here’s some TA I put together to share",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/jffcu5/i_trade_spy_options_heres_some_ta_i_put_together/,True,submission

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi’s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is “optimistic” about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell’s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans’ attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in “all-or-nothing obstruction” as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. “There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent — my goal — or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.” It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have held QBTC.U for nearly 2 months, at my own mistake of failing to do my due diligence, and have learned a few things I'd like to share:

1) Do not expect price action to move in exact correlation to real Bitcoin. For example, if Bitcoin goes up 5% in a day, do not expect QBTC.U to go up 5%, as well. More often than not, it will usually go up a fraction of what Bitcoin goes up.

2) Volume on QBTC.U is terribly low. Many a time, when Bitcoin has gone up, QBTC.U has actually gone down, or remained the same.

3) Most importantly, you should know there is a significant cost associated with buying QBTC.U which is charged to you through ""decay"". This is not disclosed by them. So, the longer you hold QBTC.U, the longer you are paying their fund through decay.

To illustrate an example of how ""decay"" affects you, it would be as follows; let us say that on a day where Bitcoin costs $10,000 CAD, you purchase QBTC.U at a share price of $10 CAD/share. Then, say that the price of Bitcoin falls to $5,000 CAD, which should \*loosely\* mean QBTC.U falls to a share price of $5 CAD/share. So, you end up deciding to hold QBTC.U until Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, to break even. Well, when Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, QBTC.U should go back up to $10 CAD/share, too, right? Wrong. Your QBTC.U shares will only go up to $8 or $9 CAD/share, which means you now have to wait until Bitcoin goes to $11,000 or $12,000 CAD, just so that you can break even at $10 CAD/share.

4) Lastly, it's worth being skeptical of QBTC.U, as I'm personally not inspired with any confidence in its integrity. As far as I'm concerned, they can just disappear from the market any day and all your money would be gone.

Long story short, if you're interested in investing/trading Bitcoin, then just buy real Bitcoin. I hope this helps some people.

## Market Notes:

No one is counting on a stimulus package anymore. The headlines can keep saying otherwise but it's not a realistic possibility before the election.

The election is now less than two weeks away. A decent percentage of the nation has already voted.

People are starting to reduce exposure to the market. Positions are being sold. The Fed is still a buyer, don't be surprised if the dip gets bought back up.

Short list today. The trend is down. Futures are lower. I'm bearish.

**ISIG** is a low float on watch

**AMTX** is a low float, key level $5

So long story short, I have a real account with a few investments in Charles Schwab.

Problem is I would like to have something like a demo or simulator where I can test out real stock with fake money. Schwab doesn't have this feature.

I have tried multiple apps, which were all rubbish. I tried Tradingview which works, but it won't let me make a watchlist unless I buy premium. I tried to sign up for Robin Hood, but it isn't signing up, the page just keeps loading but it never loads (all other websites work fine for me). I also tried investopedia, but their game has too many links for me to keep track of.

So out of desperation I'm asking here. Is there any simple simulator where I can just open up a chart and analyse it? Without paying special fees, and getting loads of confusion?

 Why I am bullish long term for TMUS. This is a stock to buy and hold.   
  TL;DR: Financials are rock solid and their technology deployment is ahead of AT&amp;T ($T) and Verizon Wireless ($VZ)   
TMUS is known as the self-branded UnCarrier. They built a brand based on customer service, cheaper plans, and spent money on building their infrastructure. Recognizing that people needed an affordable option to the giants in the industry, they worked hard to take a bite of the pie T and VZ so greedily ate from. T and VZ boasted large consumer bases, name recognition, and coverage unmatched any other competitor. Also helps these giants are from the AT&amp;T Antitrust breakup of 1984. They had capital that was unmatched. When you have this near strangehold on industry, you can charge whatever you want within reason of your next biggest competitor. The classic back-and-forth for the better deal is an industry norm but lead to higher prices for same coverage and less happy consumers. Along comes TMUS. They started to eat from the pie but realized they couldn't do it alone. So they came to Sprint with a merger. With that came customers and, more importantly, technology. Now as consumers and the industry looks forward to 5G wireless,it is becoming apparent who will be eating a larger share of the pie. T and VZ have a problem they created for themselves and TMUS is capitalizing on it. 

  
  So how is this relevant to the stock pricing? Currently, TMUS is at $115.01, T at $29.69, and VZ at $58.99. A deeper look into their financials is needed. 

  
  Quick notes:   
  EPS: + is good, - is bad CFPS and FCFPS (cash flow per share and free cash flow per share): + is good, - is bad Sales per Share: + is good, - is bad Debt to Capital: Lower number good, higher bad Fixed Charge Coverage: Higher number good, lower bad 

  
  TMUS: EPS: 2.87, YOY +16%, 5Y uptrend CFPS: $15.45 FCFPS: $6.94, YOY+1%, 5Y uptrend Sales per Share: $52.12, YOY +3%, 5y uptrend   Debt to Capital ratio: 49.7, YOY -8.9%, 5Y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 3.01, YOY +2.9%, 5Y uptrend 

  
  T: EPS: $1.64, YOY -44%, 5Y trend choppy CFPS: $7.99 FCFPS: $3.58, YOY+20%, 5y low but rising last 2 years Sales per Share: $24.66, YOY -1.74%, 5y downtrend Debt to Capital ratio: 42.8, YOY -7.7% 5y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 3.07, YOY +3.5%, 5Y downtrend except last year 

  
  VZ: EPS: $4.62, YOY +19% 5Y small uptrend CFPS: $10.21 FCFPS: $3.50, YOY+37%, 5Y small uptrend Sales per Share: $31.85, YOY +0.5%, 5Y small uptrend Debt to Capital ratio: 61.5, YOY -7.06%, 5Y downtrend Fixed Charge Coverage ratio: 4.75, YOY -4.87% 5Y downtrend 

  
  So as you can see, VZ has great financials compare to T or TMUS, yet their stock is low. Why? Their debt. 61.5% D2C and a FCC of 4.75, with the trends going the wrong way. VZ also has had slow subscriber growth lately. Its churn rate (customer loyalty) is going up, which is bad. It is currently at 1.3% according to Statista.com   
  Then you have T. T is a very diversified company. While its bread and butter is its wireless side, it has a lot more places where it is taking hits from. Of these are the entertainment, TV subscribers, and its wired “landline” DSL, phone, and fiber to the home base. It has to focus on a lot at once. Its revenue It also has a churn of 1.2% for its wireless side.     
  Finally, you have TMUS. T-Mobile has everything going right for it. From the sales rising to debt going down, its financials are rock solid. They also have 1 focus, wireless customers. Sales per share is HUGE, over double that of T and 62% greater than VZ. The debt is less than VZ, who is a mostly wireless company, but almost on par with T.  TMUS is focused on delivering not only value to its customer but also to their investors, boasting a near 100% increase of FCFPS over T and VZ. Their churn rate? Less than 1%. They boast the most loyal customers now of the big 3.   

  
  So from a financial stand point, they are solid. What about their technology? 

  
  5G is around the corner and is the current rage. T and VZ are boasting 1 gigabit per second (Gbps, not to be confused with GigaByte per second or Gbps) straight to smartphones! That is fiber speeds done wirelessly, with a latency that rivals coaxial wire services. Yet, it comes with some catches. First, it uses mmWave technology. This is high frequency radio waves. Sounds good right? Kinda. While it delivers fast speed, it has next to nothing for strength. It is easily blocked be your hand. The current solution is to have multiple antennas in your phone so your hand doesn't block the signal. It also typically has short distance as it is best when it is in line-of-sight (LOS). The technology isn't there yet to help it go beyond 1 mile. So how is TMUS uniquely positioned?   
Well, short version is TMUS bought Sprint. Sprint owned a mid-band wireless spectrum (2500mhz or 2.5ghz). T and VZ doesn't have this band. This band has a theoretical maximum of 900Mbps. It is also currently deployed in Europe as the foundation of 5G there. No other carrier has this band. It reaches several miles. Real world results is somewhere around 125-250Mbps, latency around 14ms. This is huge, Not only does TMUS now own this band, but Sprint was rolling it out. This band is a game changer.     
  So what does T and VZ own?     
  VZ only owns a lot mmWave band of 28ghz and 39ghz. This is the one that they boast reaches 1Gbps speed. It also has very short distance so it requires a lot more cell sites. More cells, more upkeep, more capital. This is great for venues like stadiums or very densely populated areas, like cities. But the limitations is its lack of power. Simply turn your back to the cell means you lose signal. The fall back is 4G LTE.   
  T owns some 24ghz and and some 39ghz licenses. They will be deploying these to pockets of dense areas within cities. So again, you have either low band 5G or 4G LTE   
  TMUS and T also own a low band 5G. This is the band near where 4G LTE currently sits. We already experience it. Typical download speeds of 30Mbps is normal. However, expect to see a 15-20% increase with it being used in 5G. How does that work? They update the equipment and backhaul. 5G cell towers also allow for more people connected before being choked by number of users. This is where T gets away with renaming 4G LTE as 5GE, as these towers have upgraded equipment but its not “true” 5G. This spectrum will be the backbone of 5G. It allows for several hundred square miles of coverage with 1 tower.   

  
  Awesome. How can TMUS keep becoming more valuable? Well, they've started it already. 

  
  You know the #1 thing rural customers dont get? Decent internet. Currently, DSL is what covers most of rural America, if they can get it. When they do “get” it, it is usually less than 10Mbps and going through cable that was laid in the 1970s and 1980s. I would know, I work for a very large ISP. In fact, VZ has sold off most of its landlines to Frontier (in bankruptcy). T still has many hundreds of thousands customers on DSL. T and other Telecoms have lobbied, and won, the ability to just stop providing service to customers because it costs too much to maintain. That leaves gaping holes that Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) are trying to capitalize on. Most people have cellphones and have resorted to using them as hotspots or buying a hotspot from their cellular company. Have you seen their prices and datacaps? VZ offers a “5G Jetpack” for $60/m and only 10GB of data. You can spend $150 a month and get 40GB. That is still a crime.   
  So all of these guys are trying to test out 5G Home Internet. Sounds good right? Let's refer back to the technology. 5G Home Internet from VZ or T will have great speeds... if you are in a densely populated area. In fact, you wont get much better speeds than what your phone currently gets if you are outside of densely populated areas. There is also the consumer base they currently have. They are starting to shut down high cost DSL areas and switch people over to more expensive hotspot plans. So this is a conversion of their customer base. VZ, once fully deployed, will now be able to compete better against T. So you wont see much customer growth here. In fact, you'll start seeing losses. Those losses? They are brand new TMUS customers.   
  Remember that midband Sprint owned? It goes further and offers higher speed than 4G LTE and low band 5G? Yep, TMUS is starting to deploy a no datacap home internet. This will be what propels TMUS to rival VZ and make better returns for investors. This will be brand new customers for TMUS. Where will these customers come from? You will see people leave CTL (Now LUMN), FTR, T, VZ, WINMQ, and SATS (Hughes Net) for the new competitor. More choice, more speed, ability to bundle phone services. What more could go better for TMUS? The only other new competitor you will see in the home internet arena is StarLink but it has yet to reach its full potential and may never reach the low latency that 5G is offering. People will drop their 10Mbps DSL, 25Mbps WISP, and 30-40Mbps 4G LTE cellular internet for a 125-300mbps, mid-band, cheap, low latency no data limit contender known as T-Mobile. While T and VZ will be busy converting their customers from 4G LTE to 5G with little subscriber growth, you will see TMUS boast subscriber growth like never seen before.",StockMarket,"Why I am long TMUS, a look into the technology driving 5G",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ivts28/why_i_am_long_tmus_a_look_into_the_technology/,True,submission

I would think: ""Ummm... duh... to have more money than I do now!"" However, now that I am 38 years old, I understand the question a little better. I want to provide safety and security for my wife, our two children, and our dog. I want to have a good job that I value and find happy moments doing. I want to travel, I want to be with my family and friends whenever possible. I want to live in serenity and not fixate all the time on money and things I do not have. 

Thusly, their sage advice, was to invest in index funds, ETFs, and 'set-it-and-forget-it' modes of saving so that I could focus on my goals mentioned above. 

I find that I turn to the stock market - if I am really being truthful to myself - when I am struggling with chronic worries and chasing short-term fixes (often with longer-term consequences). The intensity of my overwhelming emotions (re-starting work amid pandemic, my little children being a lot to work with each day, my wife being unemployed since December) is a lot to handle and the quick dopamine shot of watching a stock turn green for a bit on Robinhood gives me just the distraction I need to not focus on what is really upsetting me. However, then, as we all know, it turns red. I start to fixate, obsess, look every 5-10 seconds, watching that ticker bump up or down and just praying to God I didn't just lose my family money (thus jeopardizing the very things I value mentioned above). 

I hope all of you are doing well - I truly believe the more we all do better the more we all do better (a Paul Wellstone-ish sentiment) - I just wanted to let you know my experience in case it could help anyone make wiser decisions when it comes to the stock market and investing. 

Were you to be experiencing similar anxieties as I have been, what works better for me is: taking long walks, doing the things I mentioned above as my goals, cooling off, practicing mindfulness breathing or meditation, anchoring myself where I am, and monitoring my body and mind and how I am feeling to gauge whether or not I am enjoying what I am currently doing. (i.e, if I am losing whole days panicking over stock - which I have done - then perhaps I am not in my comfort zone and could be spending my time more wisely doing something else).

But there's one thing that I don't think people have really touched on; if a successful active investor is genuinely skilled and can often beat the market, what would be the point of telling Warren Buffett or anyone else about it in the first place?

If someone can so consistently beat the market, it's not hard to assume that that person will become rich in a few years or so. But there's a lot of problems that come with letting anyone know you're rich; people will despise you out of jealousy, friends and family will ask you for money and get upset if you refuse one day, people will marry you just to divorce you and take half your money later, and if a friend of a friend of a friend knows that you're rich they might rob you. There's literally no reason to let anyone know that you're rich. And in the case of investing, there's no reason I can think of to tell people your strategies, if you're successful and know why. Even in the case of professional mutual fund portfolio managers; if you really are skilled, then why would you even want a ""real job"" if you can generate an income at home via Robinhood with your own funds?

I ask because my mother is friends with a rich couple who explained that they got their wealth from investments but were never willing to disclose what they are or how they were able to figure things out. Thus, when people state that stock picking skills are rare or non-existent and it's mostly based on luck or risk, are they somehow taking a lack of self-reporting into account? How can you be so sure if there's no incentive to telling anyone about it?

Don't get me wrong, seeing my own holdings continue to decline after technical indicators predicted otherwise leads me to believe the overall message that skill might not exist.

“A lot of people are for the first time looking to freelance as a way to make a living during the pandemic because of the unique challenges of the pandemic and because of how flexible freelancing is,” Upwork’s Chief Economist Adam Ozimek told Yahoo Finance’s “The First Trade” this week.

Another lure of the freelance economy is the earning potential. According to Upwork’s study, 75% of respondents said they earn the same or more in pay than when they had a traditional employer.

The demographic of the freelance economy is also quickly changing due to the pandemic. In the study, freelancers consisted of 50% Gen Zers (age 18-22), 44% Millennials (age 23-38), 30% Gen Xers (age 39-54), and 26% Boomers (those over 55 years of age).",StockMarket,"Study: Freelancing surges in coronavirus era, workers find pay, flexibility attractive",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/iw5vdu/study_freelancing_surges_in_coronavirus_era/,True,submission

Oracle and Walmart together could end up with as much as 20% of the entity, purchased in a round of financing that would precede an initial public offering, the companies said Saturday. Sequoia Capital and General Altantic, current investors in TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd., could also pursue stakes in the fundraising round, a person with knowledge of the matter said. ByteDance will retain majority control.

TikTok’s decision to pick Oracle was influenced by another company, Zoom Video Communications Inc., which recently moved some of its videoconferencing capacity to Oracle’s cloud business, Redwood City, California-based Oracle said Saturday in a statement.

Walmart said that while terms aren’t final, it has tentatively agreed to buy 7.5% of TikTok Global and that it would provide services including payments, e-commerce and order fulfillment to the new company.

Friday the market broke down below critical support and this morning futures are sharply lower. This confirms the breakdown in my eyes. We appear to be in for a bear run.

Don't try and call the bottom here. It might be the open today, it could be March lows, or lower.

Interestingly there were a lot of stocks making 52-week highs on Friday. I'm willing to be selectively bullish with tight stops in place.

It's starting to seem like nobody has any idea what's going on when it comes to the deal to spin off TikTok global into a newly independent US company.

Just hours after ByteDance claimed that the terms of the deal with Oracle and the White House would allow it to retain 80% ownership in TikTok Global, President Trump said during a TV interview that ""**China must give up majority control, or no deal**.""

Does that mean the deal is 'off' again? It's not really clear. Because immediately after, Trump said the planned TikTok IPO would dilute China's ownership to minority status anyway (American investors - a host of VC firms - already own 40% of ByteDance, and with TikTok and Oracle expected to take a combined 20%, it's not clear how ByteDance's 80% ownership would break down between Chinese and American investors).

TIKTOK IPO WILL BRING DOWN CHINA CONTROL OF U.S. CO.: TRUMP

Minutes later, Axios reported that, contrary to prior reports which gave Oracle and Wal-Mart a combined one-fifth stake in the company (which is being valued at a whopping $60 billion), the American corporate odd couple would have ""no ownership"" in the new entity. If that's the case, then what, exactly, is Wal-Mart even doing?

At this point, **investors should take everything they see and read about the Oracle-TikTok deal with a grain of salt**.

Except, perhaps, this: In today's WSJ, the paper's editorial board slammed the Trump Administration, saying that it would be better to ""kill"" TikTok than move ahead with this ""statist"" monstrosity of a deal.

As WSJ reminds us, since the deal was apparently never approved by CFIUS, it could ultimately face a retroactive review like with the Grindr deal, since TikTok collected reams of U.S. user data including IP addresses, geolocation-related data, browsing and search history, and cookies.

As the title suggest I am fairly new to stocks and have a quick question for Microsoft.

I am invested in Microsoft for the long term, and don’t plan on selling for at least a few years as I genuinely believe in this company.

With this being said, with the big news of their recent future $7.5bil purchase of gaming studios, why is the stock still in decline? 

Could it be a reflection of the entire stock market as a whole? I understand we are still in uncharted waters during these times, but how do stocks typically react with such big acquisitions? I believe this is one of the biggest gaming acquisitions possibly of all time.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Stocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve’s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.

The sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday’s losses and soured overall market sentiment. It appears that after the historic rally in August and since the March bottom, traders are rethinking the prospects of a continued, sharp economic recovery in the face of no additional fiscal stimulus. The volatility this month highlights the effects this still-raging pandemic has on the economy. 

Another 860,000 workers filed for unemployment claims this week, with claims remaining below 1 million for a third straight week. The number of unemployed persons also fell below 13 million, an encouraging sign for a recovering labor market.  

Fed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus. Powell said, “It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.” Again, Powell is urging Congressional lawmakers to pass additional fiscal stimulus.

The expiration of the CARES Act and enhanced unemployment benefits have left millions of Americans unemployed and without support in the middle of a pandemic. While the stock market is okay (relatively), Powell and other FOMC members have stressed the financial burden this pandemic has placed on small businesses and individuals, urging Congress to pass more fiscal stimulus. 

President Trump agrees with Powell and on Wednesday called on congressional Republicans to support a massive economic relief bill with “much higher numbers” and stimulus payments for Americans, abruptly proposing an entirely different plan from what the Senate GOP sought to advance in recent days. Trump advocated for the $1.5 trillion plan unveiled by the bipartisan house committee, the Problem Solvers Caucus.  The proposal includes a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individual Americans, a provision omitted from an approximately $300 billion plan Senate Republicans tried unsuccessfully to pass last week. Pres. Trump said, “I like the larger amount, I’ve said that. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money.”

Trump’s claim yesterday that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by November went against statements made the same day by Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield said he does not expect a vaccine to be ‘widely available’ until the third quarter of next year. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows responded by saying “not sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it’s not based on those that are closest to the process.” In response, the WHO said, “It is important  we have consistent messaging by officials worldwide”.

In an unfortunate development, WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic. Europe has reported 300,000 cases in one week, the highest 7-day total since the start of the pandemic. In total, Europe has reported about 4.9 million coronavirus cases and 226,524 deaths.

1544,watercat55,t2_32r96b1k,1600723101,ix9lvt,2,/r/StockMarket/comments/ix9lvt/nio_as_an_investment/,1,"NIO is a Chinese Electric Car company. They have an opportunity to grow as a premier EV Company. In July 2020 they delivered  2,610 cars. Tesla led the market with 11,575 cars delivered in July 2020. As shown by this link [https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020) China's influence on the EV market grows with every year and is the biggest EV market in the world. NIO currently trades at $18.75  a value that may look like a premium to others but an opportunity once it grows as a bargain. According to CNN business NIO has  1 year forecast of $120.46 according to 16 analysts. [https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio). This looks like a premium value for NIO which it is. The future is Electric as more countries realize that ICE vehicles will not help with Global Warming targets. According to the Agust from NIO ""NIO delivered 3,965 vehicles in August 2020, a new monthly record representing an 104.1% year-over-year increase."" They will grow as they are expanding their monthly vehicle output to 5 thousand per month. 21,667 cars were delivered in 2020.  NIO is the 7th largest car manufacturer with 21,667 cars delivered throughout 2020. In my opinion they will continue to grow not only because of NIO cars, but with NIO Home a place where NIO car owners can meet and hangout and boost productivity. NIO home adds an extra element as a subscription model which is very profitable as shown by Microsoft and streaming services.  NIO is trying to be a brand such as TESLA. NIO is one of the first company with Battery swap instead of plug in. This is great for high density locations as they can grow and pack them in places with lost of people to service lost of people. Also NIO just launched BaaS which allows you to rent a battery and make the total car cheaper. The NIO car is already cheaper then a Tesla Car. NIO will grow not only because of Battery swap because it takes less then 5 minutes got change your battery and have a full battery. Also NIO is working on an app to allow you to buy preowned cars and since the battery is swappable it can be reused many times. This is my opinion on why NIO will become a big car company in China. This may turn out to be a terrible investment but it is one I have to take as a see the future of green energy and EV cars as they can help slow down global warming which will only get worse by year. The great investor Warren Buffet once said""*Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.” Climate change is a seriuous probelm and through innovation NIO will become a great investment and will help solve this serious threat to our society.*

So as long as you make sure you close wash sale positions, you still take that same loss and have nothing to worry about. Is this right?

I’m fairly new to trading and wanted to create a longterm dividend portfolio. What happens if the stock, like AT&amp;T, has a high dividend yield and is a recommended dividend buy but also has a year on year declining market value?

Some extracts:

According to the popular *market cap to GDP ratio*, the U.S. stock market, collectively, is about 77.0% overvalued. Despite the worst economic backdrop since the Great Depression, stocks have held up reasonably well since the March 23 bottom. While it’s true that the stock market has disconnected from the underlying economy, it has also done so in the past. With such an extreme level of overvaluation, it does beg the question, “Are we witnessing the formation of another bubble?”

**Stock Valuation-How it Works**

One of the more popular methods used to determine if U.S. stocks are undervalued or overvalued is the *market cap to GDP ratio*. This ratio compares the total market cap of all U.S. publicly traded stocks with GDP. More specifically, it calculates the total value of the outstanding shares of all U.S. domiciled, publicly traded companies (the numerator), and divides that number by total GDP. For example, if total market cap was $20 trillion and GDP was the same, stocks would be considered fairly valued (eg; $20 trillion / $20 trillion = 1 {ie; 100%}). During this pandemic, GDP has fallen while stocks (and market cap) have risen, creating the highest level of overvaluation since the ratio began in January 1971. This is another way of saying that stocks are extremely overbought.

It’s important to note that stocks can remain overvalued for an extended period. However, at some point, stocks will fall (or GDP will rise), and the ratio will decline. While there is no way to be absolutely certain when this will occur, the ratio does offer insight.

Currently, the degree of overvaluation is around 77.6% (177.6% – 100% = 77.6%). The previous record high was 49.3% on January 26, 2018. Prior to that, the highest reading was 49.0% overvalued in March 2000, just as the Tech Bubble burst.

Why was the ratio so low during the 1980s when stocks soared? Although stocks rose mightily during the decade, GDP was strong, which kept valuations from rising too much. Plus, when Reagan took office, stocks were more than 50% *undervalued*. While getting inflation down to a manageable level, Reagan began to deregulate various industries and embarked on a series of tax cuts, all of which created a boom period for the economy and the stock market.

**What About Today?**

A cursory glance at the far right of the chart will reveal a massive 32.9% drop in GDP (bottom graph) and a rising stock market (middle graph). The combination of the two have created the record overvaluation. Though we know the economy is improving, we do not know if the improvement will be enough to bring the ratio down to a more comfortable level.

There are other factors contributing to the record overvaluation. Very few investment categories offer a good alternative to the stock market. Cash is paying next to nothing and bond yields are at historic lows. You could invest in gold and silver and some high-flying tech stocks but buying these after such an increase could prove risky. With a lack of alternatives, you might say stocks are the only game in town. Moreover, suppressing interest rates helps to “steer” investors into stocks – a technique known as financial repression. Financial repression was first used by smaller, emerging economies when its debt became elevated. When an abundance of money flows into stocks, it tends to push stock prices higher, which in turn makes investors *feel* wealthier. This is known as the “wealth effect.” Low interest rates also make it easier to repay debt.

Looking at the Stocksplit history - Microsoft did its last Split ( 2-1 ) back in 2003 , always trying to hold the stockprice under 100 $ . ( Stockprices now : ~210$) 

Microsoft has ~ 7,5 billion stocks outstanding  , after a 2-1 it would be arround 15 billion 

—Compared to Apple—

Apple has ~ 4,3 billion stocks outstanding , leading it to a 17 billion stocks outstanding after the split

A reason for me that microsoft hasnt announced anything yet , might be the planned acqusition of tiktok. If they are sure they can accomplish the deal , they have more potential „buyers“ which would lead to a potential Split.

Apple has just hit an incredible milestone. You may have guessed it. Yes, it became the first [tech stock](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks) to pass the $2 trillion mark. This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. There’s nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13). Let’s take a closer look at what’s ahead for the iPhone maker and why the growth is here to stay.

## Ongoing Transition To 5G Network To Give AAPL Stock A Boost

One of the key drivers in Apple stock growth would be the next-generation 5G mobile technology. Technology analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush said that “Apple has a ‘once in a decade’ opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months as we estimate roughly 350 million of Cupertino’s 950 million iPhones worldwide are in the window of an upgrade opportunity.”

Many experts believe the new 5G iPhone would be a game-changer and it will be a defining chapter for the world’s largest tech company. Apple is slated to launch iPhone 12 in October. The question is, how important is the iPhone 12 to Apple? Ives said that Wedbush believes that many on Wall Street “are underestimating the massive pent-up demand around this super cycle for Apple, which remains the opportunity for the bulls.”

## Apple Services &amp; Wearables Segment Continues To Outperform

Even though the novel coronavirus continues to persist in the second quarter, Apple was able to generate growth, with revenue that increased by 1%. For the fiscal third quarter, Apple produced a record, with revenue up 11% year over year, while earnings per share grew 18%. This came amid the strong performance among tech companies. And investors have certainly been piling into tech companies that benefited during the stay-at-home orders. These include companies with products and services related to remote work, cloud computing, music, and video streaming, and digital payments, among others. 

That’s not to say when the pandemic is over, the services segment would drop. In fact, before the pandemic, services have already recorded strong growth. Wearables such as AirPods and Apple Watch have also recorded strong growth. They could see a higher number of unit sales in the next quarter.

The pandemic only served as a catalyst to boost AAPL stock higher when the hardware sales were recording slower growth. As a matter of fact, the pandemic actually played to Apple’s strengths. The company saw Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ and the App Store all performing better during the lockdown. 

## Is Apple Stock To Buy?

Apple is likely to see increasing retail demand for AAPL stock after the stock split. The company is able to leverage its massive user base to drive strong growth in its services and wearables segment. The highly anticipated first 5G iPhone will likely whet the appetite of iPhone stalwarts globally. These are some of the few areas investors might want to pay attention to see if AAPL can reach the $3 trillion mark in the near to medium term. With all these in mind, is it any surprise to say that Apple is still one of the [best tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/investing/looking-for-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-2-to-watch-right-now-2020-07-16)?",StockMarket,"Apple Hits $2 Trillion Market Cap, Is AAPL Stock Still A Buy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/idfm4b/apple_hits_2_trillion_market_cap_is_aapl_stock/,True,submission

I've been interested in trading and have been reading/watching videos for a while now but am still left with a couple of questions:  
\- The country I live in charges 0.35% tax on every stock you buy AND sell. For instance: you buy 5 stocks at 20 USD each for a total of 100 USD then you pay 0.35 USD of tax on this transaction. Same thing if you sell. This means I would need to make at least 0.70% profit (not including other fees) to make a profit.  
Would it still be interesting to go into swing/day-trading knowing that the profits will be lower?  
A good thing to know is that options (and also futures and CFD's) are not subjected to this taxation, so I was thinking that this might be a better option ;) for me.

\-This brings me to my second question: Are there any courses that I can follow that will give me the greatest chance in succeeding in the long run? There seem to be a lot of courses online but I find it difficult to find one with good reviews where I know my money will be well invested.

# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.
*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.

&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.

&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.

&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”

&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.

&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.

&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.

&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.

&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”

&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.

&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.

&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.

&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.

&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”

&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.

&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.

&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.

&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.

&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.

&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.

&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.

&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

The quick and skinny is I’ve owned this stock speculatively for months, riding it from the low 30’s to the mid 60’s today. Last week I moved all in in both my cash and SEP account. Holding 2500 shares long.

BTAI released their Phase 3 results yesterday and their new drug BXCL501 was a resounding success. The stock price was expected to explode, with most analysts targets focused on the mid $100 range. (The current range of targets is $120 - $200)

They are releasing another dataset for another drug they have in August and I expect that we will steadily climb until then with some strong pops upward and then explode on this release. 

This stock WILL be trading at over $100 in the next 30 days. Those who have the patience will reap the rewards.

If BTAI lacks anything its eyes on their company and that’s building. This is a winner

Almost every interview of his includes contradictory information. It would probably take an hour-long YouTube video to explain all of the instances, but I'll just go by a few here that you can watch yourself. A few quick instances first:

* His company obviously copied Tesla by naming their company after Nikola Tesla, just choosing the first name instead. Then Trevor has the audacity to say that he can ""out-Elon Elon"". K, based on what? All of your past failures?

* His company is a patent-troll. They sued Tesla for $2 BILLION, over something so incredibly stupid, and *expected* Tesla to pay out because ""they have billions anyways"". This is on the level of those people who fake-trip in a Walmart and sue because ""they have billions anyways"". It's trolling/sociopathic behavior.

* Trevor said ""they're focusing on products that generate revenue"", which is why they got into hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) long-haul trucks. This was *completely contradicted* by their introduction of a pick-up truck, off-road 4x4, and a HFC jetski. Like, those are fun products, about 95% of customers buy those products for fun, not to make money off of. 

* He cashed out $70,000,000 in NKLA stock and purchased a $35,000,000 home before the company even sold a single truck.

* NKLA applied for a $4 Million PPP loan, despite Trevor cashing out $70,000,000 in stock, and his company being worth Billions (on paper, but they still have a credit line). 

* On numerous occasions and interviews, Trevor talked about their company being ""vertically integrated"", i.e. owning the entire process from design, to production, to hydrogen fueling. What's really happening is their trucks are being built by a company all the way in Italy (or Germany), and then shipped to the US. He also has no plans on building out the Hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The ""renderings"" they keep showing he says will only cost ""$10-15 Million each"". That's ridiculous, the renderings for his HFC truck-stops are massive complexes that take up tons of land. Yeah, that's okay for Arizona and Utah, but not in the urban environments where most Trucks operate. And if you only have HFC-filling stations on the outskirts of cities, they'll be busy all the time which will increase transit times and cost more money. It's not like a Tesla Charging station that can just be built in a parking lot or near a loading dock. 

* Videos of their ""warehouse"" are all empty. It's not like Tesla's Fremont plant where there are thousands of workers. 

* NKLA went public through a ""reverse merger"", which isn't always bad, but it's still a sneaky/backdoor way to become publicly traded and in my opinion is worth staying away from on that basis alone. 

* The terms of their lock-out period expiration are just ridiculous. Some people are becoming millionaires before anything has even been sold. All they did was photoshop a few renderings for a few months, and that's somehow worth millions??

* They don't even plan on having any trucks for sale for *years*. That means the next few years they're just going to be burning investors cash. Reminds me of DryShips, MoviePass, Theranos, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qn2p3Lrn4A

* Their ""Badger"" truck is nothing more than a rendering, and they're already accepting deposits for it?? That doesn't make any sense at all, it's *years* away from production. Their truck is nothing special compared to something like Rivian's or Tesla's, and both of those companies actually have working prototypes.

* It'll be interesting if ""Nikola World"" even has a Badger Truck to show off. (Also, the name completely sucks)

* He always sidesteps questions asked by interviews and twists the questions. She asked about them not producing a pickup truck, and then he says ""Well we have made a truck, we made the world's most advanced HFC truck..."" Yeah, not what she was talking about.

* Anheuser Busch has made FREE reservations of about 800 trucks, but they haven't committed any money to the project. Anyone can go reserve a truck for free. Reservations ARE NOT sales, and Trevor talks like they're sales. That's what got Enron in trouble in the 2000s with their ""Mark-to-market accounting"" tricks.

* In this interview, he mentions ""fun"" way too often. Not really sociopathic, just kind of weird. 

* They threatened to sue Bloomberg over the fact that their truck wasn't functional, which was true. If you haven't performed safety testing, then the truck isn't functional. People don't buy products without safety testing. That's why they're not actually following through on the lawsuit, because Trevor knows they would lose.

* He uses the same logic as Elizabeth Holmes, when she would spout that bullshit like ""First they say you're crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden, you change the world."" Worked out well for her, lmao!

* Why do they have such a big factory/warehouse space in Arizona, when their trucks are being ""hand built"" in Germany (wait, not Italy anymore??)? Also, hand-built means not an assembly line, right? He also continuously gets his dates messed up. In this interview he said they'd be beginning production within the next few months, [but in this article he says production won't begin until 2021](https://www.electrive.com/2020/02/07/nikola-tre-to-be-built-in-ulm-germany/). 

* Why is he taking shitty vertical cell-phone footage of trucks? Can't he have other employees do that?

* He talks about ""tickets to Nikola World"" like it's fucking Coachella or something. It's a company-sponsored event dude, no one gives a shit. Ooh, you get a $100 ticket if you put down a $1,000 deposit for a truck that's not going to be coming out for years?? What a deal!

* That factory in Ulm, Germany he keeps mentioning? Right now, they only produce [fire trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveco), they don't even manufacture semi-trucks. So, uh, they're just going to convert from building diesel powered fire trucks to building electric and/or HFC trucks? Has that ever been done before ever?

* [Trevor thinks that two days of reservations is enough to forecast an entire year's worth of reservations.](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/i-ve-got-a-message-for-nikola-s-ceo-and-he-may-not-like-it-15365601)

* In that article, he takes all criticism as ""haters"" or whatever, and not people who just want to understand what's going on. That's cult-like behavior, something to avoid in droves if you ever see it as an investor. 

I could go on, that's what I've seen so far, and I'll probably keep updating this in the future. Result: I'd stay far away from this stock simply because they have nothing for sale for years, which is ridiculous. The CEO acts like a sociopath, and seems to embody the types of traits seen in other sociopaths who were engaging in fraudulent/vaporware products. They're just going to burn through any money that investors have added before delivering anything.

Edit: As mentioned in the comments, Trevor Milton isn't even the CEO any more. That job has been taken up by [Mark Russell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/06/12/nikola-stock-surge-turns-ceo-mark-russell-into-hydrogen-truckmakers-second-billionaire/#2acd467c31d8) who was the former CEO of Worthington Industries, a metal manufacturing company.

Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (NYSE: PSTH/U) is positioned for success given its size, sponsor and structure. It will trade at $20 per unit, which includes one share of common stock and 1/9th of a warrant (with potential for an additional 2/9th warrant post-business combination). Here’s what you need to know when $PSTH will likely go public on Wednesday (7/21/2020).

* **Activity: BUY at &lt;$24**
* **12-month Price Target: N/A**
* **WX Capital Portfolio Allocation: 0% (time frame does not match)**
* **WX Capital Anticipated Investment Timeline: Long-term (&gt;12 months)**
* **Qualitative Risk Level: Medium**

**Key Stock Drivers**

1. **SPACs have had tremendous returns on investment (ROI) before and after identifying a target company to bring public, averaging at 9.2% and 41.4% respectively.** According to SPAC Insider, the average SPAC that has IPO’d and is searching for a target company to acquire is trading at a 9.2% premium. This  premium may range from 0% to 40% depending on the sponsor of the SPAC, which we’ll get into later in this article. Similarly, the average SPAC that has announced an acquisition target trades at a 41% premium. The premium here ranges greatly from 10% - 200% and depends heavily on the target company. Based on our assessment of SPACs, $PSTH has the potential to trade on the upper end of both ranges post-IPO and post-acquisition announcement. Here’s why…
2. **$PSTH is raising $4B to acquire a company - this gives them an advantage over other SPACs because $PSTH will have access to companies other SPACs won’t.** The SPAC space is getting competitive as the number of SPACs going public increased from 7 in 2010 to 65 in 2020. The more SPACs on the market means more competition for high-quality private companies to bring public. $PSTH has an advantage by raising $4B because it can access more expensive, higher-value private companies than others. Because of this, $PSTH has a higher chance of success and the target company will likely be high-quality, which will result in a higher trading price post-IPO and post-acquisition announcement.
3. **$PSTH has a big name sponsor which has been shown to drive the SPAC share prices post-IPO.** Investing in SPACs is similar to investing in venture capital (VC) or private equity (PE). It effectively allows investors who do not have the capital requirements to allocate capital towards an investment vehicle (the SPAC) which a team of seasoned investors will leverage to invest in a private company and take it public. SPACs with name brand sponsors often draw the most attention because they are well connected in the VC/PE world and have a higher chance of acquiring a coveted private company. For example, Chamath Palihapitiya acquired Virgin Galactic through his first SPAC and his second SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia II, is trading at a 20% premium because investors are looking for him to acquire another company like Virgin Galactic, which is trading at a 150% returns since going public one year ago. Similarly, RA Capital’s SPAC is trading at a 45% premium since IPO’ing despite not having a target company because investors know RA Capital is a leading firm in the biotech space. $PSTH has the benefit of having Bill Ackman backing it, which will draw significant attention as Ackman is a well known activist investor who recently turned $27M into $2.6B during the COVID crisis in March.
4. **Finally, $PSTH has a unique tontine structure which will increase the likelihood of a successful business combination and for the SPAC price to trade on the higher end of the average range of SPAC returns post-acquisition announcement.** The concept of “tontine” comes from a popular insurance policy during the early 1900s where investors are paid out more as other members of the fund die. The concept is relevant to $PSTH because the SPAC will distribute warrants from investors that redeem their units at the initial business combination (these are investors who “die”) to investors who decide not to redeem. This will promote a more successful business combination because a SPAC can lose a lot of traction if investors decide to redeem their units for the base price if they do not like the target company. 

**Key Stock Risks**

1. **Potentially high opportunity cost given $PSTH has stated a time frame of up to 2 years to find a target company.** SPACs typically have a two year time frame in which they need to identify and acquire a company. By investing in a SPAC early on, investors are committing their money to a 2 year time frame in which the SPAC’s share price may not increase significantly. Until the SPAC announces an acquisition, the shares may remain at a slight premium and sometimes may drop under the initial SPAC IPO price.
2. **Potentially high premium at IPO given excitement around SPACs and $PSTH in particular.** Given the current market conditions and the excitement around $PSTH in particular, the share price may trade at a premium at IPO. This puts investors at risk of paying too much before any real value-add catalysts have happened. 
3. **Bill Ackman has had a history of taking large risks which resulted in nearly $1B in losses.** Ackman is known for shooting for the stars and sometimes landing on his face, such as his Herbalife short, which cost him nearly $1B. There is no guarantee that Ackman will find a coveted target company that will result in significant returns for SPAC investors. SPACs that have done poorly post-acquisition announcements have traded at 30 - 40% of their IPO price.

$PSTH is a SPAC that will catch many eyes because of its size, sponsor, and structure. Excitement will be enhanced even further as SPACs have had a lot of success recently with DraftKings, Virgin Galactic, and Nikola going public and have seen upwards of 700% returns. While there are a lot of drivers for $PSTH success, there are some risks to be considered. However, given the excitement around SPACs right now and the promising sponsor backing it, $PSTH is certainly a SPAC to consider.

""As U.S. stocks climb to their most expensive levels in two decades, the executives in charge of the companies benefiting from the rally are showing signs of anxiety.

Corporate insiders, whose buying correctly signaled the bottom in March, are now mostly sellers. Almost 1,000 corporate executives and officers have unloaded shares of their own companies this month, outpacing insider buyers by a ratio of 5-to-1, data compiled by the Washington Service showed. Only twice in the past three decades has the sell-buy ratio been higher than now.""

I am mostly satisfied with their service, however I never tried another to really know the difference. I've try looking up different brokerages but their trade commissions have weird confusing structures that I didn't want to bother with because I just wanted to keep things simple. The past two days, however, really made me a little angry with them for their lack of stability. I kept on getting error messages stating that I should contact them when I'm trying to put through an order (I'm currently on hold for 1 hr 48min and still waiting as I'm typing). New stop buys must have a limit above asking prices, which is ridiculous because those change all the time in the pre or after hours. If I'm allowed to maintain my previous stop-limit buys where I'm certain at some point the asking price goes beyond my entered limit, then why can't I enter a new one? Today, my stop-limit for AMD was ""rejected"" for some reason not stated even though the price crossed my stop-limit buys. Is this because their servers didn't put my order through quick enough? Now I'm missing out on gains and am pretty pissed.

Green energy appears to be in play, fueled by good numbers from TSLA. The VIX is falling as the market appears to be getting more bullish.

I think the expiring unemployment benefits could be a factor in the coming weeks. That benefit provides $15 billion in additional spending every week.

They are one of the cheapest sources of funding for loans, helping the industry mint record profits even in a time of low interest rates.

&gt; But banks, which will be cautious lending money in the midst of a recession, are running out of uses for their growing mountain of cash, according to Foran.

&gt; One consequence for savers will be more immediate, says Foran: Banks are sure to lower their already paltry interest rates, since they don’t need more of your money.

I’ve been wondering who’s been buying multi billion dollar loans of struggling companies before the Fed stepped in.

I'm new to day-trading, there's a deluge of time-consuming information of mixed quality on YouTube. I'd like to learn most quickly.

""Warrior Trading"" by Ross Cameron is the first day-trading learning module I've encountered.

Is it a scam… or is it an honest entity with good value, provided I'm willing to put in the time and effort to learn?

What about competitors? Are there any worth considering?

WT boasts 5-star verified reviews, and RC boasts verified profitability of his personal trades.

However, TradingSchools-dot-org appears to list only bad reviews about WT and every other group they list. Is there any good option? Is that site's opinion even worthwhile?

This phenomenon reminds me of ""coding bootcamps"" (Hack Reactor, App Academy, etc), which also have mixed reviews, raving love-fanatics, and raving haters.

I want to learn day-trading, and I know my time is valuable. If someone can save me time wandering the web to learn, that's a valid service.

Thank you.

A record $2 trillion surge in cash has hit the deposit accounts of U.S. banks since the coronavirus first struck the U.S. in January, according to FDIC data.

The wall of money flowing into banks has no precedent in history: in April alone, deposits grew by $865 billion, more than the previous record for an entire year.

Deposit gains were concentrated at the very top of the industry: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup grew much faster than smaller firms in the first quarter, according to company data.

Last night was one hell of a night for investors. The [US stock index futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) slid by more than 400 points after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that the trade deal ‘is over’ on Fox News. This came after the long tension between China and the US over the handling of [coronavirus pandemic](https://stockmarket.com/investing/health-care-stocks/3-ai-healthcare-stocks-to-watch-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-06-22). 

Later, Navarro said that his comments were “taken wildly out of context”. He said it has nothing to do with the phase one trade deal, which continues in place. Shortly after, Trump also said via Twitter on Monday night that “The China trade deal is fully intact. Hopefully, they will continue to live up to terms of the Agreement”. 

## 2) Coronavirus News Feeds Continue To Be The Major Highlights

With increasing efforts to reopen the economy across all fifty states in the US. As the market appears to look more hopeful amid business activity gaining ground. Market sentiment seems to cool on news of the spike in cases in certain states. But not to the extent of what we saw in March. 

Despite seeing more cases, we note that the number of deaths is declining. That shows the healthcare system is beginning to deliver some positive results. The world is in a better position now if you compare it to a few months ago, with various potential therapies on trial. With social distancing and face masks now mandated in certain states, hopefully, this could slow down the transmission of viruses and eventually eliminate them.

There has been quite a bit of investor’ optimism over the prospect of a global economic recovery. This has been challenged by a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in the US and China, as well as parts of Europe and the Americas.

## 3) US Stock Futures Reverse Course After Trump’s Reassurance

US equity futures reversed losses after Trump said the trade deal is still intact. Global stocks also rebounded from a sharp dip after Washington retracted Navarro’s comment. With positive sentiments across Asia and Europe, we could expect the same outcome for the US stock market today.

The friction between the US and China seems to return to the fore after the controversial national security law in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous territory. Not to mention the mistrust between both China and the US on the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. This does indicate that the market remains very sensitive to US-China tensions. Any slight negative remark could put a blow to the performance of the global equity market.

## 4) Oil Price Climbed Higher On Global Recovery Trade-Winds

With hopes of business activities resuming globally, WTI oil has rebounded to $40 per barrel whereas Brent crude is at $43.38 per barrel (at the time of writing). Some analysts have come out with bullish forecasts for the near term. But, plenty of risks remain. With infection rates not slowing down in key markets, it is reasonable to assume that we are going to deal with sluggish oil prices in a prolonged period. 

## 5) Gold Likely To Hover Around High Range

The return of the global recovery trade with a lower dollar did not stop the enthusiasm of gold investors yesterday. Gold climbed to an intra-day high of $1763.00, brushing slightly away from the $1765.00 multi-month resistance. The higher gold price appears to be contributed by some strong tailwinds from the US bond market. 

However, investors must be cautious and treat the rally of the gold price with not more than a pinch of salt. We’ve seen this before, with bulls severely disappointed as gold retreated from this resistance zone. Until we have a consistent gold price above $1765.00 for an extended period, caution is warranted as a bull-trap is possible. 

Looking forward, the US-China story and the pandemic updates are likely to keep entertaining gold traders. Additionally, the preliminary readings of June month PMIs for the key global economies might offer additional clues.",StockMarket,Top 5 Things To Know In Market This Week,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/hee8yo/top_5_things_to_know_in_market_this_week/,True,submission

Then I took a step back and didn't do anything for like 16 months because I was annoyed at myself. 

Just getting back into it and threw $300 in to play around with, and turned that into $1100 overnight.  

I'm done gambling though, I want this $1100 account to bring in some passive income.  

What I've been doing is selling SPY call credit spreads.  

Typically $10 above current price and next day expiration, for example I sold 11 SPY 321/322 credit spreads expiring 6/24 for $22 against the $1100 collateral. 

That's $22 every Mon, Wed, and Fri...or $66/week, or $264/month. 

All against $1100 collateral.  And I'll be adding that $264/month to the collateral to take more and more premium every time.  It's a banging ass ROI. 


My thoughts being, am I stupid for doing this?  I mean SPY is pretty stable and I believe it's reaching the top, and won't make a $10 move over 48 hours RIGHT NOW.  

Of course if volatility increases, the market gets a bit more iffy, I'll pull my $$$ out.  Big news, earnings, whatever.  

But as of now these past 2 weeks it's worked pretty fucking well.  Am I missing something?  I mean it seems too easy almost.  


I know I know ...if SPY does make that $10 jump and I'm all in I lose it all.  But this is just my Robinhood account, for fun. Aggressive high risk high reward.  

I have a Roth IRA I just started last year and maxed it out.  

I'm 23 and okay with taking that risk because the ROI is just too good, as long as I max out my IRA for the year and save for a down payment on a house, I'm fine funding the Robinhood account an extra $50-$100/month + the gains I get from the premium.",StockMarket,Am I an idiot?

Since then I kept believing the stock market will test the lows again, and here I am 3 months later and we are 40% up from the lows of March (had I left my portfolio untouched) - To make matters worse, I tried to recoup by trading VIX and Oil, jokes on me as I ended up losing another 10%.

Anyways, looking at the recent weeks, it's obvious that the WH and FED are not going to let the market crash again. People are now used to COVID and the world has reopened to an extent (second wave won't lead to a shut down). So,I was thinking of going back in for long term (I buy high and sell low) 

Question is, do we see a small re balancing coming up as we get to quarter end next week? so should I wait for another week? or Do you reckon, since I waited this long, I might as well wait till elections and hope there is a correction?

For the past month, I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what to invest in. After the recent bull market, finding real opportunity is a crapshoot. I've been following the news hoping to find a trend, and I think I've got it: thermal camera temperature screening. This is where FLIR, the largest thermal imaging manufacturer in the world, comes in. Today, I bought $8K in calls and $100,000 in stock. This is 1/10th of my portfolio so I don't take it lightly. 

**The Chart**

Let’s start with the chart. The stock is currently at $40 support, is forming a round bottom, and looks prime for a bounce. There was some early interest when news came out that Amazon was installing thermal imaging at all their facilities and FLIR went up 15% in a single day. Since then, hype died down and day traders took profit. Because of the low liquidity in this stock, people exiting positions caused it to fall significantly. Now that interest is picking up again, the same low liquidity is going to help this skyrocket. The time to get in is now, especially with the breaking news that LAX is using FLIR for thermal imaging. I expect this to cause a spike in the stock tomorrow once this hits the news cycle. 

Below are some links that I’ve complied. These are small snapshot to show that skin temperature thermal imaging will be the foundation of the reopening. If you search “thermal imaging” on Google News, you’ll see the hundreds of other organizations that have adapted this technology.

**Additional thoughts:**

FLIR has been moving incredibly fast on elevated body temp thermal imaging technology. They recently released new software for this very purpose and are well ahead of the competition and are transitioning to a SAAS model after a massive restructuring. It is transforming into a tech company, but is trading at an industrial valuation. 

**THE MASSIVE CHERRY ON TOP:** 

FLIR has a complete monopoly because it's the only thermal imaging company that has FDA approved products for monitoring skin temperature. Guess what that means?  Every single organization in the United States that is using thermal cameras for body temperature screening MUST use FLIR’s products. There is absolutely no alternative. That means that every organization listed above is using FLIR. 

https://www.flir.com/discover/public-safety/thermal-imaging-for-detecting-elevated-body-temperature/

**My personal research:** 

1. I called FLIR, pretending to be a customer. Their backlog is months, and they've never had a backlog this huge. 

2. I called over a dozen organizations that adopted thermal temperature screening to ask what vendor they're using. Out of the seven that gave me information, every single one is using FLIR. I even got through to one CFO who personally approved the thermal camera purchase for that facility. He said that only FLIR was considered because it was the only vendor that fit the requirements for human use. This is consistent with them being a monopoly as stated above.

* **If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday.**

If Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine proves to work, the company anticipates working “very closely” with the U.S. government to determine who will get the first doses, CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Friday. 

The company announced Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration cleared its potential vaccine for a phase 2 trial, what the company called a “crucial step.” Moderna is ramping up its manufacturing capacity so it can rapidly distribute doses if the vaccine proves effective against the virus and safe for humans.

Even so, the company won’t immediately have enough for everyone, Bancel said.

“We will all be supply-constrained for quite some time, meaning we won’t be able to make as many products as will be required to vaccinate everyone on the planet,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Last week, Moderna announced a 10-year partnership with Swiss drugmaker Lonza to accelerate the production of the experimental vaccine. Bancel told CNBC at the time that the company hopes to begin manufacturing its potential vaccine “as early as July.”

He added that with the partnership, the company hopes to be able to manufacture about 1 billion doses per year. There are more than 7.6 billion people on the planet, according to the U.S. Census’ world population clock.

Bancel said Friday that the company will collaborate with the U.S. government to determine who receives the first doses.

“In the case of the U.S., we anticipate working very closely with the government and with key medical officials to decide who gets the vaccine in the first batch. And then when you have the next batch to ship to the government, how do we allocate it between health-care workers, people who are high risk and different geographies where you have more cases,” he said.

BARDA, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, last month awarded Moderna up to $483 million in funding to accelerate the development of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

The potential vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, became the first candidate to enter a phase 1 human trial in March\*\*.\*\* The company has not published the results of the phase 1 trial yet but received federal approval to start a larger phase 2 trial soon. Bancel said the phase 3 trial will hopefully begin in the early summer.

The vaccine candidate uses synthetic messenger RNA to inoculate against the virus. Such treatments help the body immunize against a virus and can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.

The race to develop a vaccine is intensely competitive and investors are watching closely for signs of progress on treatments and vaccines. Bancel said it will take more than one company to beat back the coronavirus, which has infected more than 3.8 million people around the world and killed at least 270,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

A move above or below a 200-day moving average — a proxy for changes  in an asset’s long-term trend — is always closely watched by traders,  but the S&amp;P 500’s long courtship with that key level, as it bounces  back from its bear-market plunge, is becoming something of a fixation on  Wall Street.

But even if stocks do make it back above the 200-day, history  indicates that an extended run to the upside is far from guaranteed.

&gt; **‘A breakout is not likely to come easily and we expect a dogfight here around the 200-day.’**                  
&gt;  
&gt;**— Kevin Dempter, analyst at Renaissance Macro Research**    

The focus on the 200-day might be enhanced by the fact that the  average stood Friday at 2,999.67, just a whisker below a big round  number.

“The fact that the S&amp;P 500 is coming off a 35% rally and  that this 200-DMA lines up with a nice even 3,000 number seemingly makes  this area especially important,” said Kevin Dempter, analyst at  Renaissance Macro Research, in a Friday note. “A breakout is not likely  to come easily and we expect a dogfight here around the 200-day.”

Biotech company Moderna, which is testing one of the leading coronavirus vaccine candidates, priced an offering of 17.6 million new shares at $76 each, the company said late Monday.

The company said it expects the offering to close around Thursday, with gross proceeds totalling around $1.34 billion. Moderna is also giving the underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional 2.64 million shares in common stock. Morgan Stanley is running the deal.

The announcement comes after Moderna reported positive data on its early-stage human trial for a Covid-19 vaccine earlier Monday. The closely watched vaccine trial produced Covid-19 antibodies in all 45 participants, sending the company’s stock surging nearly 20% to close at $80 a share. 

In a previous statement, Moderna said it expects to primarily use proceeds from the offering to fund the manufacturing and distribution of its vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273 once it’s approved by federal regulators.

If there are any remaining proceeds, the company hopes “to fund clinical development and drug discovery in existing and new therapeutic areas; to fund further development of its mRNA technology platform and the creation of new modalities, or to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.” ",StockMarket,"After positive data on a coronavirus vaccine, Moderna will try to raise $1.34 billion with a stock sale",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gp64d7/after_positive_data_on_a_coronavirus_vaccine/,True,submission

Moderna Inc. got a new Wall Street-high price target from Goldman Sachs as its shares traded at a record after the biotech company revealed positive early results from its experimental vaccine for Covid-19.

An initial look at mRNA-1273, as the inoculation is known, “hits the mark,” analyst Salveen Richter said, raising her price target to $105 from $63, or 27% above the prior Street high of $83. Richter rates Moderna a buy. Piper Sandler analysts soon followed raising their price target to $102 from $57 saying Moderna could have “potential blockbuster vaccine sales next year.”

The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose as much as 2.8% and is on track to close at a record high after Moderna’s test results. Moderna shares rose as much as 30%. The entire U.S. stock market rose as the first look at a potential vaccine for the disease responsible for the pandemic kindles hope for an end to the shutdowns hobbling economic growth across the globe.

Investors are excited “the vaccine was able to elicit an antibody response at just two weeks post-dose,” Richter wrote in a client note. She was also positive on the activity seen in lower doses, which should bode well for Moderna’s ability to extend its capacity to provide more vaccine. Moderna is now seen having a 75% chance of success, whereas Goldman had previously modelled 70% odds.

Goldman was the lead manager on Moderna’s most recent stock offering in mid-February, which raised cash at $19 a share. The stock has surged nearly four-fold since then. Only one of 12 analysts tracked by Bloomberg rates Moderna a hold, while the rest rate it the equivalent of a buy.

Piper Sandler’s Edward Tenthoff said mRNA-1273 could be a $10 billion a year drug if approved. Former GlaxoSmithKline Plc executive Moncef Slaoui, who is set to become the chief scientist for Operation Warp Speed and is on Moderna’s board, has said that getting a vaccine by January is a “credible objective.”",StockMarket,Moderna Vaccine ‘Hits the Mark’ as Street Sees a Blockbuster,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gp6ee0/moderna_vaccine_hits_the_mark_as_street_sees_a/,True,submission

Tomorrow evening I'll be getting back to live streaming for /r/StockMarket for the first time in a couple months and our trusty band of Discord hooligans has voted to do a stream on **how to identify short term tops and bottoms in fast moving/volatile stocks**!

As a full time trader I spent a number of years short selling high-flying biotech stocks as well as catching falling knives (sometimes badly) and learned (sometimes the hard way) how to tell when a euphoric rally or panic-induced selloff was losing steam and a reversal was imminent. Of course no one can time the market perfectly, but by paying attention to the right details we can drastically improve the timing of our entries and exits, especially for short term trading. In this stream I'll share my experiences, the details I pay attention to and some of the ways I manage risk when dealing with fast moving and volatile stocks that have the potential to wipe you out if you're wrong.

If you can't make it, the stream will be recorded and the link to the recorded session shared in the Discord after it's uploaded. 

Here are the details and relevant links:

I kind of believe, from listening to John Bogle, Burtien Makiel, and Charlie Ellis, that looking at historical performance is not the most important criteria because no one can predict the future of equity prices and the old saying of 'past performance is no guarantee of future results' seems to hold true. I'm just wondering whether always going for the low cost is the best way to go.

The main point of this plot, I feel, should be to gauge how well your investments have done all-time.  Bank deposits and withdrawals should not be considered. 

For example, say I bought shares of BA, DISNEY, RTX. The plot graph should change each day based on the collective net profit / loss. Then having filters like “daily”, “weekly”, “1 month”, “1 year” , “all-time” can measure your profits / losses over that period of time. And yes I know that it lists the total gain next to each position. Sometimes it’s nice to visualize things especially when you’re tracking progress over time. 

I started initially using Robinhood. After dealing with their unreliable servers and terrible customer service, I moved over all new trading to TDA. Although I’ll admit, I do use RH to look at stocks that I’m watching and pull the trigger on TDA.

First company:
OpenText (OTEX)
Market cap: 10,76 billion
Current share price: 55.64 CAD

A Canadian softwate company that is the leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM), which means they help companies work more efficiently on things like the cloud and within their own systems. Their 2019 1.42 billion doller acquisition of Boston based software company Carbonite, who focused mainly on providing software backups and data protection, also gives them more strings to their bow in the ever growing cloud industry.

They have around 684 companies that use their software, some of the biggest companies are: Aegon, BMW, British American Tobacco, T-Mobile, Fox, Michelin, Qualcomm, Rio Tinto and Unilever. With more and more companies placing emphasis on online work and the importance of the cloud, OpenText is well situated to profit from these trend in the coming decade.

Second company:
TakeTwo Entertainment (TTWO)
Market cap: 15.95 billion
Current share price: 140.51 USD
Year high: 140.51 USD
Foreward PE: 32.38
Total cash: 2 billion
Total debt: 177.25 million
Estimated growth next year: -7.90% but with a 5 year estimate of 11.88% per annum
Estimated sales growth: -5.10%

They also recently signed a deal with the NBA to extend their popular 2K series, which also grants them the rights to the ever growing popularity of e-sports focused on NBA2K.

In the recent year they have also shifted their focus more towards the mobile gaming industry, an industry responsible for 60% of the global video game market in 2019 and forecast to grow much more in the coming years. With the video game market as a whole growing and more and more people using their spare time to play video games, TakeTwo is well positioned for the future growth that comes with the industry, especially as games get more realistic and virtual reality starts playing a big role in these games.

Third company:
Blackberry (BB)
Market cap: 2.54 billion
Current share price: 4.54 USD
Year high: 8.96 USD
Foreward PE: 28.38
Total cash: 909 million
Total debt: 758 million
Estimated growth next year: 166.70%
Estimated sales growth: 10.70%

Last but not least, the company that everyone still associates with their popular cellphones in the 2010's. Blackberry has fallen a long way since then, but they have since shifted their focus to software rather than hardware. Since CEO John Chen took over at the helm in 2013, he has drastically changed the future outlook of this company. Blackberry is now mainly focused on cyber security, with their QNX embedded systems software platform being their main flagship for future growth. The QNX platform is used to secure and aid self driving car systems. This platform has helped them land a collaboration deal with Amazon Web Services to produce save self driving cars. It doesn't stop there however, as they also have deals to provide security software for Microsoft, Audi, BMW, Ford, GM and the US government.

It certainly doesn't help that most people still think Blackberry is focused on producing cellphones and I have even heard people asking if they still exist as a company, but they most certainly do and I would argue they are ready for a shot to reclaim their 2010 glory days as a cyber security company instead of a hardware one.

I know there are so many factors that go into current valuations and perceived future value, but if you look at returns since we've entered the recession, some sectors and sub-sectors remain pretty heavily hit (e.g. Energy, Financial Services, and Industrials).

I know there's been discussion about the SP500 being ""[significantly overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php)"" but it seems a big part of the reason the SP500 isn't lower than what it is now is because [FAANG makes up about 1/5th of SP500](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/sp-500-dominated-by-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook.html), which have generally benefitted from this pandemic or at least haven't been as hard hit.  If it weren't for the Big 5, SP500 would probably be a few hundreds points lower.

The Eurozone’s preliminary PMIs for April will be released tomorrow, and the numbers could be abysmal. The preliminary PMIs for April will reveal just how much economic damage the pandemic has inflicted, with forecasts pointing to another drop deeper into contraction territory for both the manufacturing and services indexes.

Admittedly though, economic data don’t mean much right now. While investors could pay some attention to the PMIs since they also contain a forward-looking component, most of the price action in the euro might be driven by the meeting of EU leaders.

They will be discussing more stimulus measures, including the prospect of some risk-sharing mechanism like Eurobonds. If agreed, this could be a game-changer for the euro. It would imply a quicker recovery in the most virus-ravaged economies such as Italy and Spain, and remove some of the political risk premia.

However, despite some recent signs of flexibility, such an agreement remains very unlikely given the scale of opposition from Germany and the Netherlands. Therefore, the risks surrounding the euro’s reaction seem asymmetric. With nobody really expecting a deal, a surprise Eurobond agreement would likely push the euro much higher, whereas another disappointment might only generate minor losses.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** The wild swings and the continued sell off in WTI crude oil futures dominated the news headlines and caused risk aversion in various asset classes including Gold which was down almost 3% at one point.

like many other retail investors I was warned about the rollover losses that will come due to the contango situation that would make ETFs/ETCs unattractive. I try to understand what rollover losses in futures contracts are, but I cannot wrap my head around it.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, you get rollover losses in a situation like in the current crude futures where the near ending futures are much cheaper than the far in the future ones. So when the April contract ends, you have to move to the May contract. You get ""losses"" because the May contract is more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

An example for illustration:

April contract costs $10 per share. May costs $15. You (or the ETF) is invested with $1200.

At the end of April contract you close my position and sell your 120 shares. Now the May contracts are being bought, each for $15. So you get 1200/15 = 80 shares. 

According to what I read, this is an rollover loss. But I don't understand where the loss is. The position is still  80\*$15 = $1200. 

So where is my loss? What am I missing here. Thanks for the help!",StockMarket,Help: Trying to understand what rollover losses really are,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/g69yl8/help_trying_to_understand_what_rollover_losses/,True,submission

Gap Ups: BLPH, BNTX, FLIR, IMMU, INO, JNUG/NUGT, NAT, NLS, SNBR,  ZM

Gap Downs: AYX, CROX, CTXS, HSY, PDD, STX, TGT

Earnings season has officially started, in the near future we should start seeing some more opportunities than usual. As for today, pre market is flat while the SPY tries to make it's way over the 50 day moving average. As far as gappers go, there is a few but not many good ones that I like so I will be patient at open as yesterday was pretty choppy for the first hour or so until the market found direction. If SPY can break and hold over the 50 DMA, we have room to the 200 DMA which is currently at around 300. I feel repetitive saying this but due to the comments and messages I will continue to say it, always have a target and stop calculated Before you take any trades, this is important to eliminate emotions and give you an exit plan in case price moves against you. If you dn't use a target price then use a moving average or trend to capture profits.
