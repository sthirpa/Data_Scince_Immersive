That’s a good point. But if OP has 1 year seasoning on investment, long term capital gains tax is up to 20%. So personally, I’d rather wait 1 year and pay 20% vs living in PR for 10 years to pay 5%. YMMV

&gt;Every year you can harvest $40-80k tax free depending on your marital status plus all cap gains through your Act 22 company are zero.

254,reve_lumineux,t2_eo5n10eb,"I have mentioned this several times in my comments. Many institutions are interested in the use of NFTs, namely creative industries. The size of the institution can vary, but the industries involved are music, film, games, and virtually anything that can leverage NFTs in a way that can benefit the institution(s) and/or the consumer(s). It isn't a secret. 

Tezos is also used for NFT-minting and has been renowned for doing so for a while now. Solana Foundation and Solana Labs have been doling out awards and grants to those who are willing to develop and utilize their technology. 

Take a look at the winners of [Solana's recent hackathon, IGNITON](https://solana.com/news/solana-ignition-hackathon-winners). Many of these projects are based on DeFi and DeFi asset management, coding and analytics solutions, NFTs, and gaming.

&gt;It isn't about redditors. It is about new accounts, active accounts, DApps deployments, announcements of new DApps, etc.

It sure isn't. But this subreddit certainly represents a more 'popular' or 'adopted' consensus of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general. I've talked to a number of people who don't know or care to know about it. They know *of* it, but do they use it? No. They don't need to. If anything, most people I talk to make fun of 'crypto bros' who only talk about their portfolios and flipping NFTs.

Anyone can make claims about whether something is good or bad (morally or ethically), but most information being spread about Solana is at best cursory, and at worst misunderstood. Most hear about things about network outages related to DoS or transaction overloads (which it can still do more of than any network at the highest speed). 

Rarely do I see threads like this one where it accounts *why* that might occur, which can be done by reading core snippets of [Solana's whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf) and providing any sort of fundamental critique of the blockchain - something that's touched upon all the time (centralization and barrier-to-entry for validators), but hardly references that it's a technical limitation of the blockchain.",1639197427,ho2zgju,t1_ho2xosz,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rdblv4/i_honestly_dont_understand_why_solana_is_still_in/ho2zgju/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

You could use it like most others where you keep documents or whatever on it.

Or you could maybe modify the hardware a little or do something with it to make it into a crypto wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

What you see of the tool reflects the person. There is good and bad with anything. 

Do you think anti-cheating methods with it is good or bad? What about if a gaming company goes under and everything is built right for Web 3.0 then the game will keep running with or without the company? What about files like your saves are more secure? And so on. 

People always argued about the next thing. I remember reading a quote from someone in ancient Greece where they were complaining about kids learning how to read and how it was becoming popular in their area. That they fear since kids didn't have to remember anything since they could write down anything. Society would collapse.

Did it? No, but were they wrong in thinking something bad could happen. I would say no. Again, it's a tool and it is just up to whomever how to use it.",1639111047,hny5jt3,t1_hny2o0w,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rcv6l5/nft_good_and_bad_in_gaming_from_a_crypto_person/hny5jt3/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

1. You dont' want this to happen, because if it did, 99% of your shitcoin bags will crash 99%+. And I say this as someone who holds 0 bitcoin; I'm no maxi. But the truth is, the entire ecosystem is propped up by bitcoin, not the other way around like some newbies are deluded into thinking.

2. Economically speaking, it makes no sense. Imagine if your neighbour on your left sold their house for $50,000,000, and the neighbour on your right also sold their house for $50,000,000. Do you think that would do nothing to the price of your house? Now imagine the neighbour's house prices suddenly crashing to $10,000. Do you think your house's valuation would be unaffected?

764,afunkysongaday,t2_1xydex40,"I don't want to downplay the ideas of Ford, and probably no one will read this anyways, but have to say this: It feels like this is written to make it sound more similar to BTC than his idea actually was.

You got to understand the time frame: Gold and silver standards where the norm for the whole 19th century. This means: one unit of such a currency could be exchanged for a specific fixed amount of gold or silver. But this was changing globally: Because it created a lot of issues in war/post-war economy, most countries already turned away from gold standards to other monetary systems, mostly fia, after WWI. The US sticked to the gold standard for quite long, officially until 1935, but in 1921 it was already crystal clear for anyone with economic insight that the US would sooner or later abolish the gold standard, too. And people were discussing alternatives.

This is were Ford comes in. His idea was simple: Instead of ""one unit of this currency gets you a fixed amount of gold"" it should be ""one unit of this currency gives you a fixed amount of energy"". An energy standard if you will. He makes this very clear:

&gt;The standard American dollar is approximately one-twentieth of an ounce of gold. Under the currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to one dollar.

The idea has actually not very much in common with PoW cryptocurrencies like BTC. These use energy to compute mathematical problems, to in turn mine new currency and handle transactions. Energy is used, sure, but it's surely not an energy standard. In short: It's not and was never meant to be a currency where 1 BTC = A fixed amount of Kwh. The only actual overlap those to systems have is: They both got something to do with energy. But that's it. I could easily make the case that this system has more in common with petrocurrencies for example than with PoW cryptocurrencies.",1638765417,hnf6x1h,t3_r9efcm,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r9efcm/this_will_blow_your_mind_exactly_100_years_ago_in/hnf6x1h/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

900,Elean0rZ,t2_1574ivx,"&gt;The one single thing \[the traditional market\] has always done, is grow. It's got no reason not to.

To be fair, though, Narendra Modi, Gary Gensler, and the embalmed corpse of Charlie Munger can't just call for a ban on the economy the way they can for crypto. The main thing that's clear from that graph is that, while the economy as a whole grows, individual asset classes ebb and flow. So, while a drop from 2x on the year to a-little-less-than-2x on the year certainly isn't cause for panic, I don't think ""the economy has historically gotten bigger"" tells us much about what crypto, specifically, will or won't do.",1638592443,hn5q2pv,t3_r8h475,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r8h475/dont_panic_i_repeat_dont_panic/hn5q2pv/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

There is actually a very good book on memory and memorization called ""moonwalking with einstein"" that goes into details about how some people are able to train themselves to memorize a deck of shuffled cards after seeing it just once.  Apparently there are competitions for that kind of things.  And yes, everyone can learn how to memorize.  So do yourself a favor and memorize all your pass phrases.  And if you're struggling, pick up this little book and you'll easily learn how it's done.  

I've read the book a few years ago.  And just after I read it I decided to put it to action and memorized a 38 item shopping list within just a few minutes.   It's still stuck in my head to this day.   

I haven't needed to do any long memorization since. But I will definitely read it again before memorizing my pass phrase.",1638506176,hn12px4,t3_r7oha2,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7oha2/memorize_your_seed_phrase/hn12px4/,3,CryptoCurrency,comment

We're in a bull market.  I tell people if you want to buy in the bull market, expect that you're going to be taking bigger chances and doing a bit of timing - gambling.

1140,AnalTrajectory,t2_hwft6,"Correct. Monero wallets, transaction amounts, and transaction participants are, by themselves, very secure.

The only ways for an entity can trace your wallet/transactions is through honeypotting. If you check your wallet balance on a 3rd party website collecting your browsing info, or deposit/withdraw at a public atm, or transact with wallets deliberately recording your transaction history, that information is collected and used to construct a wallet profile that is cross referenced with similar profiles. At best, this is an approximation of an identity.

In short, a transaction protocol is only as secure as its end user. Should someone wise up to being tracked online, all they need to do is send their monero to another wallet and not do the above mentioned compromising acts.",1638419724,hmw6h29,t1_hmvv5qn,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6p04r/irs_will_pay_up_to_625000_bounty_for_monero_trace/hmw6h29/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

1483,jdickstein,t2_vaf1xkb,"That’s only one of the points I disagree with. Clearly the success of crypto.com and user growth affects the CRO price given the incentives to stake. A big cause of the price increase is new users staking to increase earn rewards and discounts on fees. They couldn’t be more related. 

Your argument that a decrease in rewards will lead to the price of CRO lowering depends on them being related actually. You can’t decide on how you think this fictional world you’ve created works from point to point. You rig the rules to switch depending on how it helps your argument.

Your argument reads like someone with sour grapes who missed out.

They shouldn’t focus on marketing? Like what? What world do you live in? Look around at everything you own. That’s 95% because of marketing. You don’t actually love Coca Cola for its great recipe, FYI. And new users wouldn’t come to crypto.com if they spent this marketing budget on coding. Marketing is literally everything in most spaces, but especially cryptocurrency. Or are Doge and Shiba mainly loved for their incredible architecture? It’s all about buzz and they’re proving it with their success and the success of their token.

The ad was cringe? It’s a stunningly sharp, well written,  well performed and well edited ad starring one of the biggest movie stars in the world. You couldn’t get a less scammy vibe. Maybe if you hired Barak Obama. And the amount they spent on it guarantees that they tested it into oblivion to the point that it definitely does what they want it to do. Your dislike of it is more a sign of your bitterness and lack of being in touch with what people like, than a sign of a problem with the ad.",1638160700,hmht68r,t1_hmhqqag,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r4eiqq/cryptocom_will_become_the_blue_chip_for_exchanges/hmht68r/,0,CryptoCurrency,comment

1596,sweet_little_oranges,t2_alxag3ku,"I don't think I could find it. They showed mathematically that between 14-20 brought the best returns. It was ok to have more than that, it just wouldn't necessarily lead to better returns. Coinbureau, for example, has about 16. I think that there are too many good projects to limit yourself to only 4-5, you could easily miss the winners. 

I ask myself this question a lot. I knew about shib in Feb, and even 200 dollars in shib would be worth a lot now. But I didn't get any because I thought my portfolio was too full. I had the same situation with quant and Elrond Gold. It's really hard to guess which ones are going to moon, if you only have 4, chances are you will choose the wrong one. 

So now, I think that there's nothing wrong with having 20 or so and just holding them. There's probably nothing wrong with having even more than that either. But you might get to a point where its not necessarily beneficial to keep adding coins. And that point you could make some choices between them",1638074250,hmd3bkk,t1_hmd1ims,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r3nke6/how_much_diversity_is_too_much/hmd3bkk/,1,CryptoCurrency,comment

We know how big a narcissist and ego maniac the Indian leader is, but, he's already facing a huge backlash due to the recent defeat in elections (local level) and also the farmers protest. He will not do anything stupid, that will hurt his votebank. The average age of crypto investors in India is 24-25 years. And the same age group, is also the reason he is in power.

You can participate yes, when there is a vote I believe you can contribute based on your stake, though its been so long since I did it I can't remember the ins and outs.

It is nice and simple though. Couple of insights, if you want to unstake, you've got to wait 28d for CRO to unbond. Once every 28d you're allowed to instant switch validators without unbonding. Rewards can be claimed whenever you like, and rewarded CRO is not staked so you may stake it back in, or withdraw it, cronos bridge it, whatever you like. The APR beats all rates in the app's earn programs.
