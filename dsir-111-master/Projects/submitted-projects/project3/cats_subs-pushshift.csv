He can never hold her, but she allows him to pet her, and rub against him. Myself however, she only rubs up against me when i am the one feeding her in the morning. Other than that she avoids me like the plague. She is a very pretty cat, and I want to be able to be her friend.

My now 11wk kitten is preventing me from getting more than 4 hours of sleep per night, is scratching my furniture and bed. He also attempts to claw and bite on cords and my hands/ankles. 
Attacks my laptop any time I attempt to do homework. 

I know this is normal kitten behavior, but is there anything I can do to calm him down at night? Any methods that have worked for you guys for preventing scratching/biting? I have tried aluminum foil, spray bottle, time-out, taking away toys, redirection to toys, a firm no +clap, ignoring him, etc. but nothing seems to be getting through to the little man. I have grown up around senior cats my whole life, I love cats and I don‚Äôt want to part ways with him.

The last two days she was hiding and seemed so out of it could barely walk and her legs were collapsing. I couldn't sleep last night I was so sick with worry so I took her to the vet first thing this morning and she said it was arthritis and maybe even some pain from inflamed anal glands that she expressed. From what I was reading I thought it was a blood clot and I was going to lose her. 

So right now we're on a treatment plan to try to get her joints stronger get some different food in her diet and she's on pain meds for the time being. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? She's getting older and I imagine this is here to stay so I'm trying to figure out how to make her life as comfortable as possible. Luckily the pain meds and the joint medicine aren't terribly expensive so it's something I can do for the Long haul if I have to.

(Btw sorry for bad english i guess)

So basically I've had a cat (male) for my entire life and he is the most pacific being to ever walk this earth. 
But a couple of months ago, a stray cat (female) just showed up in my house and adopted me, now she's been living with us for like 2 months.

The thing is, she absolutely hates my other cat. I understand, she comes from the streets and god knows what has happened to her. When she first showed up, she was really scared and aggressive, but with the time she has calmed down and now she only agressive to my other cat.

For this reason, she pretty much only lives in my room and the garden and NEVER goes any other place inside the house.

The other cat (the male), as I said, is the most pacific cat in the world and even tried to get along with her at the beginning. But after being attacked by her for no reason, he is now terrified of her.

I've tried to get them together, and even though I have seen a little bit of progress, at this rate it will be years before they are able to even be in the same room together.

So yeah... Any advice?",cats,How to get two grown cats to get along?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/r6xxu1/how_to_get_two_grown_cats_to_get_along/,True,submission

I have been feeding a few flavors of the FF dry food to my two cats for the past few years. They would flip their food bowls if I gave them anything else after they tried Fancy Feast and grew to prefer it. A few days ago, cat 1 was having frequent bouts of vomiting and no appetite. I figured he got into something because my other cat was fine. Cat 1 stopped vomiting and started eating again the next day, then cat 2 started puking. The next morning I came downstairs to their food bowl flipped. Cat 2 stopped vomiting, then cat 1 started up again. I got them a‚Äè‚Äè‚Äé‚Äè‚Äè‚Äé‚Äè‚Äè‚Äé‚Äè‚Äè‚Äé¬≠different food and now both cats seem fine, although they have a vet appointment in the morning just to make sure they're alright.

I was driving home down a dark street, engaged in a lovely conversation with my daughter, when out of nowhere this beautiful lil kitty comes into view right in front of my car about 5 feet distance, just sitting there frozen, I immediately slammed on my brakes and tried to avoid it skidding, but it was too close..

The really crazy thing, and I'm hoping it's actually a miracle, is when I pulled over and ran to help the kitty thinking I hit him/her, I couldn't find the kitty anywhere, I searched for a good 15 to 20 minutes, with flashlights, I searched yards, road, both sides of the street, every where nearby, couldn't find any trace of the poor lil kitty,

Now I'm sitting here at home unable to get the poor baby's face outta my mind, I see it's lil black and white face clear as day seared into my mind

 I have an suv a lil high off the ground, I am praying that because he/she was frozen and I drove over him/her allowing it too escape, first thing I did when I got home was held my kitty diddles

After looking at the bowl, i saw a divet in the middle where her face obviously was and I realized that when cats eat, its like bobbing for apples and once the food clears the point of entrance, its a bit difficult for cats to grasp the motive to shuffle the food around to be able to nom it again.

She meows and cries constantly. I don't know what she wants. 

She will follow me around and just won't stop. She meows but also makes this weird noise that kind of sounds like a human baby. I don't know what it is about it but it drives me absolutely insane.

I give her food, I give her attention, pets, play time, none if it is sufficient. She will hang out in the kitchen, cry and cry and cry. We put her food out. She eats a little and leaves. Then she stops in the hall, turns around, and starts crying at us again.

If we ignore her long enough she will usually go settle in and go to sleep. 

I took her to the vet today, she does have an ear infection, but this has been going on for a long long time now. 

I love her but something about the sounds she makes just drives me insane. I'm at my wit's end, I can't listen to it anymore. It's constant.

I have a lovely 1.5 year old kitty that I've had since she was about 4 months old. I love her so much - she is my pandemic baby. She is truly the definition of a sour patch kid. Meaning, she's very sweet half the time, but so annoying the other.

Like many others, she is food-OBSESSED. She is constantly jumping on the counter/in the kitchen sink to try to lick food scraps. When I tell her to get down she hesitates and gives me this look before meowing as she jumps down, as if to say ""FU mom."" She does this over and over every evening. I have tried using the spray bottle, I have tried putting aluminum foil on the counter - nothing. She gets fed 3 times a day. At her recent vet check up I was told she is a perfect weight.

She looooves attention - playing, cuddles, etc.  If I go to the bathroom and she's in one of these moods she will scream at the door because I'm not letting her in (separation anxiety? idk). I play with her until her little heart is RACING or until she gets bored and walks away. 

The worst part of it is her night screaming. I get up at 4am for work and this tiny ghoul chooses to go batshit crazy anywhere from 2:30-3am. If I leave my bedroom door open she will knock things off my dresser and nightstand. If I lock her out she will literally SLAM her body into my door while screaming. For at least 20 minutes. I honestly don't know how my roommates sleep through it. 

She has a huge crate of toys. My roommate has a cat that will often play with her as well. I even got one of those cat backpacks to take her on walks to keep her from being bored. 

I know the answers are usually: ignore, ignore, ignore. And also, play until exhaustion. But of course, she chooses to sleep from 7-10pm, the time when I am normally going to bed. So I guess my question is, do I wake her up just to try to get her to play, just so she will be exhausted and hopefully not wake me at ungodly hours? Or am I stuck with an insane cat who will hopefully chill out in her older years and I should invest in some good earplugs to help me sleep through the night?

About 7 months ago, my brother decided he wanted a cat (he lives alone) and as a first time cat owner he messed up big time and got a tiny kitten. I warned him about separating a kitten from it‚Äôs mother too young, but at the time he didn‚Äôt quite grasp the seriousness of the matter and went ahead anyway. The kitten got more and more hyperactive as time went on, and started to tolerate handling less and less. She would nip and scratch if she didn‚Äôt want contact. I convinced him to get a second kitten to help her get socialized, but the damage was already done. The second kitten was being terrorized by her because she would play too rough and he would squeal, cry and hide. This went on for a while‚Äîthey were clearly not a good match (opposite temperaments) and so I decided to adopt her and he kept the male kitten. She‚Äôs 8 months old now, he‚Äôs 7ish, and they still can‚Äôt play together without him growling and hissing. 

So now I finally have a cat, which is something I never thought would happen...but I find myself getting jealous of other cat owners. This isn‚Äôt how I would‚Äôve gone about getting a cat, and now it seems she will never tolerate another companion, so this is it as far as having cats for me. It makes me cry that I love her so much, and just wanna show her affection and receive affection back without fearing an attack. I know her to a T, and understand her body language so it never gets to that, but I can‚Äôt handle her and love on her like other people do with their cats. And it leaves me wanting more. Just to be clear, I love her to death and I‚Äôm extremely attached to her, but my heart still longs for an affectionate cat. Thanks for letting me vent.  

TLDR: I finally have a cat, but her high strung temperament wont allow me to pet her and love on her and it makes me jealous of other cat owners.",cats,I can‚Äôt help but feel jealous of other cat owners,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/r65pop/i_cant_help_but_feel_jealous_of_other_cat_owners/,True,submission

How can I, eight hours later, still be grappling with the fact that he‚Äôs not here anymore? My heart is whispering to me, ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôll be scratching at your bedroom door tonight. He‚Äôll be laying in the bathroom or the cat tree, and you‚Äôll walk by and pick him up, hold him like you always do.‚Äù 

But he is not here, only the bitter emptiness and salty tears that stream down my face in remembrance of his face. The sporadic sobs that emanate from this  hole in my chest where his love once filled. His soft fur and paws, his white mark on his nose, his one white whisker above his brow. His attempt at meowing that often  was just an opening of his mouth. The way he flopped onto my chest, as close to my face as he could. The way that I would hold him like a baby on his back, his large paws would rest against my face, his yellow eyes would close and he would purr.

He had gotten so big in just a year. Exactly a year. From that tiny kitty that couldn‚Äôt breathe and fit in the palm of your hand, to a large majestic cat full of sweet love for the people who had handled him from birth. He had been born at the wrong time and his mother did not break him out of his sac. He nearly suffocated but was brought back to life. He was a miracle boy. 

He lived long for a cat who had already been dead. There is a strange, sad poetic irony to the fact that he only lived 366 days. That he graced us with his presence for just one year, only to be ripped away so suddenly by a car. I still cannot believe my precious boy is gone. Never to be in my arms again. 

I love you, Morty, my big baby boy. I will never forget you or your sweetness. 

Morty

We have a 15 year old cat who‚Äôs had kidney disease for some time. Lately her condition has taken a turn for the worse. She‚Äôs having trouble walking and her hind legs seem stiff. The left more than the right. She still goes to the litter box but has been having the occasional accident. She‚Äôs still trying to eat, but isn‚Äôt eating much. She went from 5.8 lbs to 4.7 lbs. We took her to the vet to and we were told she has the following conditions :

-hypertension 
-pronounced heart murmur. 
-non regenerative anemia 
 Here are her blood test numbers:
- creatinine: 10.8
- BUN: 97
- Phosphorus: &gt;16.1
- Calcium: 11.7
- Potassium: 2.6
- Hemoglobin: 8.9
- RBC: 5.9 (possibly elevated because of IV fluids given in the last 2 days)

The vet recommended euthanasia, saying that anything they do to treat the kidney issue would cause heart failure and anything they do to address the heart issues would cause kidney failure, and I was too distraught to ask more questions. Does it make sense to ask for a second opinion since she is still trying to eat or drink?",cats,Senior cat - looking for second opinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/r5dr2n/senior_cat_looking_for_second_opinion/,True,submission

Our cat developed the ability to speak on the phone with my husband.

When he was at work, I'd put the phone on speaker, and he'd say her name and she'd meow back at him.

I played this clip of him saying her name today since his passing and I could tell in her reaction that she really missed her daddy.

I've posted a picture or two of him here before, and anyone who knows me, knows my baby, Teddy. Teddy has been a major part of my life ever since we adopted him in 2009 when I was only 10. Two days ago, with him at 12 years old and me at 22 years old, I had to say a very hard goodbye to my angel. It was the longest and saddest day of my life. 
Growing up Teddy was my best friend, the sunshine on dark days, the warmth when it was cold. He was never much of a cuddler but he always stuck by my side. He did stuff with me he wouldn't tolerate with anyone else. We'd play peek-a-boo in the hallway, share bottles of water, I could roll him over onto his back and he'd look happy as can be on his back, feet curled up, a huge smile on his face. 
He brought so much joy, hope, happiness, and love into my life when it felt otherwise dark. He was loved so incredibly much. He will always be my baby, my best friend, and a part of me. He was one of a kind. Words cannot express how deeply he means to me and how deeply I will miss him. I hope he doesnt doubt how immensely I loved and cared for him. We had a bond like no other, and he took a huge piece of me with him. I love you my darling baby boy, then, now, always and forever.

I want to get in the swing of routinely bathing and brushing teeth, but my cat is feisty. He‚Äôs a bit of a tough guy. He was rescued from the streets (although he was clearly domestic at one point). 

I have given him baths maybe ~4-6 times and he hates it and attacks me. It is the only instance where he attacks me. I was wondering if he will ever get to the point where he will let me.

Unfortunately, not giving him baths is not an option. The poor guy gets anxious and carsick in car rides and he vomits and has diarrhea. So obviously, after that, he needs a bath.

I know there‚Äôs treatment options, and I have been somewhat in contact with the Facebook group.

I‚Äôm so heartbroken and I feel hopeless. I feel like a horrible cat mother knowing that I will most likely have to put her to sleep or let things play out even though there is treatment that is just out of reach. Feeling like shit about the fact that technically, technically, I could sell belongings, wrack up debt I can never pay back, and extend myself as far as possible, but that it would put myself through so much emotional and financial stress and would prevent my ability to spend time with her and care for her to the best of my abilities, for something that isn‚Äôt a guaranteed permanent fix. I‚Äôve already reached the end of my saved funds with trying to diagnose her and treat her so far. I hate myself for giving up like this but I don‚Äôt know what realistically else I can do. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some kind words, maybe some advice on what I can expect and what I can do to help her with this. She‚Äôs experiencing fever, abdominal fluid, and lack of appetite. She‚Äôs pretty sleepy and snuggly, but I can tell she‚Äôs uncomfortable. I think it is pretty early, since the first time I took her to the vet a few days ago she didn‚Äôt really even have abdominal fluid, but I don‚Äôt even know how fast this will progress.",cats,My cat has most likely FIP.

Her weight has been an issue for years but because she lives with my parents they haven‚Äôt been able to put her on a consistent diet. Luckily, I‚Äôm back home and can manage her so at the advice of my vet we put her on a diet. Essentially she‚Äôs carb addicted and has a deep passion for consuming dry kibbles. We‚Äôve tried putting her on diet in the past, like slowly weening her off of dry food, giving her less carbs and trying to sneak in veggies to make her food go farther, but she‚Äôs reacted badly to all of those attempts. Her diet for the most part had been a hybrid of wet food and dry food that worked for our other cats, but obviously not for her. Our vet said to Cold Turkey her off of dry food and supplement with wet food. We only started recently but it‚Äôs apparent she isn‚Äôt reacting well. She is absolutely refusing to eat her food, she takes a few bites of the wet food and leaves then it remains uneaten for hours on end. I tried jazzing up the wet food mixing in veggies, cooked chicken and salmon, but still just looks at it and leaves. She‚Äôs been trying to get at the dry food the other cats eat, sitting by the door and yelling like she‚Äôs dying(we separated them when eating for obvious reasons). She‚Äôs meowing all night and having behavioral issues in the day. It‚Äôs only been a couple days but I can‚Äôt help but worry about my once voracious eater of a cat.

He often drools and there‚Äôs occasionally blood in the drool.

I already took him to the vet and they recommended a full dental surgery where they remove his teeth. I don‚Äôt know if I want to do that because all in all, he is a happy cat, and surgeries are risky and could change that. He eats all his food (I only feed him wet food) and is playful and energetic.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Could they recommend anything to help with the bleeding? Or anything at all while I think about the surgery.

I just recently adopted a kitten (4 month presumed male, setting up a vet check ASAP) from a home that was adopting out their cat's newest litter. I was told they were extremely briefly litter trained but may have some unfamiliarity. My cat at first refused to step in the litter box (uncovered) even when I'd try to set them in it they'd squirm and try to avoid touching the litter at all. I changed litter (Dr Elsey's Kitten Attract) to try to entice them to use the box but still the same thing. I set up multiple boxes at different points in the apartment to see if they like a certain location more and even one where they'd been unfortunately going when avoiding the box. I don't think this is a medical problem and all medical issues I've seen have symptoms that I'm not seeing in them. I took some litter out of one of the boxes and they will scratch at the bottom as if trying to bury excrement then sprint to the other side of my apartment and immediately pee/poo. The newest box I set up (where they were going instead) looked promising and they even scratched in it but immediately walked a few feet away from it and tried to pee. Every time they try to use the bathroom in a bad spot I've tried to quickly take them to one of the boxes to show them where they have to go but I'm feeling stuck. Sorry if this is a mess but it's been a sleepless few days since I'm on constant high alert.

However, ever since they have been exposed (trying to do bursts and not leaving them with them 100% of time) our cats have been getting into fights with each other a lot more often than what would be normal.

I‚Äôm having two 6 month old kittens spayed tomorrow and the vet said to withhold food and water after 6am, with the drop off time for surgery being 8am-9am. Her exact words were ‚Äúno food after 6am the morning of surgery.‚Äù I thought this was a little odd since every time I‚Äôve had a cat have surgery (2 times) they didn‚Äôt eat anything the night before. I thought maybe since they‚Äôre kittens you aren‚Äôt supposed to fast them for so long so I went with it, especially since it was mentioned that way in two emails. Now I‚Äôm starting to worry since every source I‚Äôm seeing online from other cat owners and vets says no food after 6pm/11pm depending on who‚Äôs talking (basically the night before surgery).

Well both of my kittens have eaten this evening. It‚Äôs about 10:40pm where I am I took there food away a little bit ago out of worry. I know I should‚Äôve just called the vet since I found the time she gave odd but I‚Äôm trusting her to give me the right information. So has anyone had this where the vet told them a similar time? Is it normal for kittens to not fast for as long before a spaying?

I‚Äôm going to call in the morning to double check and worst case scenario I will reschedule.

And the transit might be traumatic. It's a tricky situation! Would you take them with you if you were me..knowing the flight is going to likely be traumatic?

The one that likes being in my mom's room will pee on her bedding often, so she keeps her door closed almost all the time. Sometimes, she gets trapped in there and will pee on the bedding, while other times she'll choose to pee in there regardless if she's stuck.

I clean my cats litter (they have two seperate boxes around the apartment) very often. They're given plenty of food and water and have lots of toys and things to climb on to see outside. Generally, they're very loving and affectionate cats and they have never hissed once. Only the one pees on my mom's bed, is there any way to fix this? My mom wants the cats out at this point because she's tired of having her bed messed.

I got Akira (F) over a year ago and I recently got Yuki (F) this past March. It took awhile for them to coexist, I would say around June is when the fighting stopped happening. They will sleep near each other, chase each other, and wrestle one another. However, sometimes Akira will hiss while they are wrestling/playing and her tail will be going back and forth fast. Then, once she breaks free from Yuki, she runs right back in and starts wrestling her again! She will also sometimes try to smell or lick Yuki‚Äôs butt, but Yuki will run away at this point. Does this indicate that they are engaging in play? Furthermore, they lay near each other and have no problem being in the same space (we have two laundry baskets next to one another in the closet and they will each sleep in one), but I am still not entirely sure if they are ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I am pretty positive they don‚Äôt hate one another, but is there any way I can help them bond? They are both cuddly cats, and it is sad that they don‚Äôt cuddle/groom one another.

I adopted a 4 year old cat 4 months ago because he was in a terrible condition (hair loss, abscess, no neutering, underweight, no shots) My parents fed him but that was the extent, so he was used to people. Don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs fat, fluffy, and healthy now‚Ä¶.my poor wallet.

I live in an apartment with 3 other cats, one who tolerates the other cats but loves to growl (8 yr F - she‚Äôs all bark, no bite), one with EXTREME anxiety (3 yr F), and another chonker who only cares about food and cuddles (8 yr M).

Anyways back to my point, I‚Äôve been trying to introduce this new cat to my current cats and have been hitting a brick wall. He doesn‚Äôt like my females nor do they like him. He will attack all of them second he can, and my little fluff ball with anxiety will also seek him out and try attack. After 4 months, I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Do I continue to try and introduce them or just try and re-home him. He is a sweetie pie that loves to chill with us, heck of a groomer on my roomie‚Äôs hair, and lives to play. But, he‚Äôs still learning how it be less aggressive, so there are small non-bloody bites every blue moon or scratches because he gets too into the playing.

Currently he‚Äôs in my roommates room, but i let him out with us and put the cats in my room. I alternate like this everyday every few hours, don‚Äôt want to keep him in a little room all day.

I'm no stranger to pet allergies and my room having an irremovable smell that lingers out from the hallway because of thise doggies is extremely familar.

My allergies get really bad with my dogs. So much so that while I was never formally diagnosed with an allergy to dogs, I might as well be.

With cats my symptoms range from jarring pain in the eyes and extreme irritation to a mild sniffle and redness around my eyesockets.

My mother isn't so lucky, unfortunately.
She'll literally bleed from the eyes and have extreme swelling, irritation, and redness in both. It's not fun, so she's never had a cat. On the other hand, my older brother is completely fine in interacting with felines as he lives with 2 (maybe 3? not sure) cats that annoy him to no end without any symptoms at all.

So I ask this, (because I think I'd like a cat)
What breed is the best in your opinion for someone as allergic as I am?

Is there any allergy preventative medicine I could take or rather shedless cats (It's the hair that'll kill me /s) that would be top priority to get if I were to adopt one?

My cat, Pumpkin, is a 13 year old tortie. She was a stray we took in and we fell in love with her immediately. I took an instant bond to her and she never leaves my side, even when I'm breaking. She crawls on my chest when I'm upset and lays on me and purrs until I feel better.
When I was 17, (now 26), I was at the worst time in my life. I had lost 2 grandparents to Alzheimer's and dementia and almost lost my sister to suicide. But Pumpkin stayed with me the whole time, and when I was ready to end my life, Pumpkin kept me from doing so. Literally. She knocked the stolen pills out of my hand and onto the floor, almost as to say ""No, Mommy. I won't let you do this."" I took my cat's advice and spoke to someone, went into psychiatrist care and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Pumpkin has been by my side ever since.
And when I started seeing an older man at 18 who was no good for me and was abusive, she let me know by trying to bite him. And she is the sweetest cat to literally everyone. 15 months later, he left me for being ""too crazy"" and Pumpkin was with me through every step of the breakup and subsequent medical and psychiatric care (again.) I call her my unofficial emotional support animal because she is.
And when I had stress induced seizures, she laid against my back until the seizure passed, even though she could have been hurt. And Pumpkin even got mad at the EMTs for taking me away from her.
When I'm sick, she's my nurse, when I'm tired, she cuddles up next to me. I can't sleep without her purring next to me. And she officially moved in with me and my husband last month after our wedding. It's been a transition for her, as she's a dominant cat and my husband (who is perfect in every way and helps me as much as Pumpkin does), has a dominant male cat. They're slowly getting used to each other but no fights so that's a great start.
She's still with me, just cuddling next to me right now. And I wouldn't have it any other way. I love you, baby.",cats,"I Saved Her, and She Saved Me",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/r1nrk7/i_saved_her_and_she_saved_me/,True,submission

We're in a small space, so we constantly have to dust surfaces to ensure they're fur free, lint roll ourselves to make sure we're not tracking fur everywhere, and generally be careful with everything around the house.

**Info:** We have two 1.5 yrs old medium-hair cats. They are indoor only. They eat *Blue Buffalo Wilderness High Protein Grain Free, Natural Adult Indoor Dry Cat* food. They also drink a bit of water during the day from their bowls. No wet food. 

We brush them daily to stay on top of the undercoat shedding. Everyday, we get a fair bit, which is somewhat soul crushing because it seems like whatever we brush just gets replaced immediately. We thought it'd end at some point. 

We dust surfaces everyday, and we have a robot vacuum that cleans the floors everyday. 

**Advice:** I'm wondering if anyone can offer suggestions on how to reduce shedding at the source---the cats body. I'm not looking for cleaning tips, so much as things I can do to minimize the shedding itself.

We have one small female cat, and one larger male. I'm sure many of you will be familiar with this story: the male won't stop eating her food, and she will stop eating at the slightest disturbance, and won't let anyone see her eat.

We want her food to be protected, and also to prevent the male from overeating to prevent health issues. We tried separating them, but they prefer to graze throughout the day and probably night.

We got her eating out of the bowl insert, but she seems too afraid to eat it out of the dispenser, even when it's open. We've been scooting it closer and closer, hoping to start it's gradual ' training mode' before using it as intended. But she just isn't cooperating.

So a few months ago we mentionned to our vet that our young cat(Kimchi, male) (I say cat because he‚Äôs a big boy, but I think he‚Äôs not considered an adult yet (?)) was extremely full of energy even at night. She recommended that we got another cat to play with our own while we‚Äôre away at work so that by night, he‚Äôd feel a little less crazy.

Two weeks ago, we adopted a little female kitten (Wasabi). We established our office as Wasabi‚Äôs quarters until we decided it was time for both cats to meet. The thing is, the door to our office has a pretty big gap under it so Kimchi and Wasabi quickly found out about each other. It was never a huge problem tho, as they both seemed to play with eachother quite nicely. 

This week, we started introductions. We did this by serving them both wet food at the same time, in the same room followed by a play session with a toy (the kind with a fake mouse at the end of an elastic rope tied to a stick) in which both cats participated equally. After that we allowed them to play together freely, and that‚Äôs when it gets ugly.

Everytime Kimchi gets a moment alone with Wasabi, he sniffs her a bit and bites her (playfully I think because she doesn‚Äôt seem to complain) until he goes for the neck. Of course when that happens, we immediatly separate them. At first this happened s little while after they had time together but as time passes it seems that Kimchi only ever wants to attack Wasabi. What worries us is that this behaviour doesn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. Kimchi is much bigger than Wasabi (the vet said he‚Äôd become a huge cat because as I mentionned he is quite big for his age, without being fat tho). He easily overpowers her. Even when he‚Äôs not supposed to see her but sneaks in the office as we enter it to feed Wasabi, Kimchi seeks her and almost always tries to bite her neck. Weirdly enough tho, is that when Wasabi is in her room, Kimchi meows at her door, almost as if he was asking to play with her, and she sometimes does. But every time we remove the door as an obstacle, Kimchi seems more violent than playful. He seems afraid and mad before attacking.

Do you guys have any advice? Are we rushing things by having them meet already? Did we skip steps? Ideally we would prefer to keep both of them, but we would like to allow Wasabi out of the office soon since we feel like she gets less attention because of her being restrained to only one room.",cats,How to make my 7 months old cat not kill my 4 months old kitten,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/r0ul4x/how_to_make_my_7_months_old_cat_not_kill_my_4/,True,submission

I have two cats. One is 3 years old and the other is 6 weeks old. I've had the 3 year old cat for almost 3 years and I got the kitten when she was about 3/4 weeks old (not really sure of her age.) But before someone says that I should not have gotten a kitten that young...  I had no clue she was that young due to not actually knowing the woman trying to get rid of the whole litter and other cats. I only knew the woman's friend and that's how I ended up with a VERY young kitten. I took care of her very well considering I haven't had a kitten that young in a long time. Once I heard that the woman that I got the kitten from had over 20 cats and they were all feral, I knew I was not taking her back since she was so young even if it meant she was going to be with her mom. I hope that wasn't a bad choice but I love cats and I would hate to see this one living outdoors especially since it is getting colder and there were so many feral cats already there.

My 3 year old cat was very scared when I got her. Not sure of her history but I adopted her from an animal shelter that picked her up from a neighboring city. She's still scared of most things like loud noises and lots of people.  My room is her safe space because it is always quiet.

Anyways,

I still live at home with a parent and I spend A LOT of time there because of online classes and stuff. The cats really like me because I am their sole caretaker. They have lots of toys, cat trees, beds, and blankets all in my room so I spend time with them very often.

I got accepted into a really nice university and I will be moving on campus next fall! The only issue is that my cats cannot come with me (obviously... although I want them to.)

This will be my first time away from home and I am worried that my cats will forget about me or not like me as much as they do now after not seeing me for periods of time.

She hasn't (yet), so now I'm in a tizzy wondering if the hydrogen peroxide will hurt her further.

The elderly couple living here before us probably took care of strays because there is an old empty barrel on the porch, with a hole in it.

There are two cats we often see roaming around the house: a big ginger cat and a grey one. Both cats seem well fed, but they have no collar, so I don't know if they belong to a loving family and just go out to explore, or if they've been abandonned.

When they come here, our cat gets pissed off. She stares at them through the windows, hissing like hell. We've never seen a cat use the barrel on the porch as a shelter, but we've seen the ginger cat hide behind the barrel and pounce on a beautiful downy woodpecker that was peacefully eating suet, killing it. We removed the barrel.

My boyfriend don't want anything to do with those cats, scaring them away each time they come here, and I understand that. We love feeding birds and don't want them to become easy prey, but it breaks my heart knowing these cats are outside in the cold, as winter is coming... we live in Quebec, and it gets very cold in winter, between -15¬∞C and -30¬∞C.

I can't take them in, and my boyfriend don't want them on the property... I can't put a new shelter anywhere, and I can't feed them, otherwise we'll be ""stuck"" with them... is there something I can do to help them, and at the same time keep them away from here?

He was neutered before coming home. When we first brought him home, I had him in the bathroom with a blanket, food, water, and litterbox as well as a little hideout, although he managed to get into the vanity drawer to hide anyway haha so Wednesday, I moved him to our spare bedroom and he's been doing good. Definitely still nervous but I've been spending time laying on the ground in the room and he's coming closer and smelling me. He still won't let me pet him but he does run around and play with his toys and boxes and eats while I'm in here so he's getting more comfortable. Then, today he peed on the bed! He had been using his litterbox perfectly so I am surprised, I just scooped it last night. One of the times was definitely while I was in here (I saw it but didn't react cuz I didn't want to scare him) and the other time was dried so it was either earlier today or yesterday.
What should I do? He obviously knows to use the litter box since he's been using it. Should I move him back to the bathroom so he has less space to go in an inappropriate place? He has NOT yet been introduced to our resident cat but I'm sure he has smelled her. And I'm sure he's still stressed out from all the changes. I appreciate any and all advice. Our last cat was litter trained when we got her 11.5 years ago and has never peed outside the litter box.
Also, I washed the sheets and cleaned the mattress with the extra strength Nature's Miracle. It has a VERY strong smell so I'm hoping it'll deter him from peeing there again.",cats,Newly adopted kitten advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/qzb8z7/newly_adopted_kitten_advice/,True,submission

I am 19 and live with my parents deep in the country. they have fleas, bad. they never die. ive used flea powder, foes bombs, flea soap, etc. they stay alive when we are here. She has always lived in my room ( my parents have huskies in the living room so she cant leave, my room is big, like a studio apartment. ) and she has always been content with that. I give her a good life and she is very happy. loves every person she meets. 

Anyway, the past few weeks, she has been hiding in a small crevice next to my bed all day and night and not coming out. she usually sleeps with me, not anymore because she is always hiding. two days ago, i decided to cover the crevice so she couldnt go undet there anymore, thinking it‚Äôd help. but no, she just found another small crevice in my closet to hide in all day and night. she eats, drinks, etc. but just hides all day and wont spend time with me no matter what. 

vets said she looks fine, our usual vet gave us a better flea medicine for her and also gave us a 10-day medicine for her skin ( apparently she just got a skin infection from scratching the fleas. ) But he didnt answer anything about the hiding. why is she doing this? im so worried, i miss my cat. i asked them if she was going to die or looked sick and they said no but why else would she be acting like this?? theres no way that her skin being a little inflamed rn from scratching would completely make her distance herself from the world. i signed a lease to move out so yhat shes not staying in one room 24/7 but the apartment wont be ready until january 15, please help.",cats,PLEASE HELP ME IVE BEEN TO TWO VETS AND ITS NOT HELPING!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/qzbk6w/please_help_me_ive_been_to_two_vets_and_its_not/,True,submission

His poop has also been really soft which isn't normal for him. This tells me that this probably isn't car sickness. He's thrown up both wet and dry food, both of which he normally doesn't have any problem eating. He's been super quiet and looks like he's in a lot of pain, so I'm going to take him to the vet tomorrow. 

In the meantime, I don't know what to do. Should I continue to feed him little amounts of food every now and then? My mom said that I should try to give him some rice and while I did some research on that (I found that a little amount is okay for them and helps with digestion), I'm still hesitant to give him some. 

Any suggestions out there? I'm really worried for him and I just want to make sure he's comfortable.",cats,"Sick kitty, please help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/qzc17z/sick_kitty_please_help/,True,submission

So I pull the hair out, if didn‚Äôt have any resistance besides the feeling of me pulling hair out of a bum?? Not sure If that makes sense but idk how else to describe the feeling of pulling hair out of a kittens bum. 

I later googled what this meant and now I am worried I might have caused my kitten internal bleeding. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. He‚Äôs acting fine and is his usual self but can someone who‚Äôs experienced this or knows what I should do comment some tips.

She‚Äôs gotten heavy and the vet recommended she lose some weight. She‚Äôs a total glutton. She can eat a quarter of a cup of dry food in less than 5 minutes. Then proceed to chew through chords and valuables the rest of the day until I keep refilling her plate. She won‚Äôt even play if there‚Äôs no kibble out. We definitely end up over the recommended amount for her weight. I‚Äôve been trying to switch her to wet food for about 3 months now but she‚Äôll just lick up the gravy and leave the rest sitting. Then she goes back to destroying things until I give back the kibble. Any suggestions on wet food or dry food that can help with weight? My vet didn‚Äôt give me any feedback about this.

Hi r/cats! I recently got a feline roommate for the first time. He is 8 months old, intact (neuter planned in 2 weeks), and is a lovely fella who has a surprisingly similar personality as mine. During those past couple months we lived together, I had him most of the recommended vaccines and had a health check last week. 

I am a Korean living in California, and I haven't been to my home country due to COVID for a while. My working Visa is extended recently, and around the same time my employer relieved its policies about international travel (technically it was always possible, but was very very highly discouraged). And I decided to go to Seoul around Christmas. 

And my anxiety is peaking because of my roommate. I know cats like to have a safe zone, and new environment is huge stress to them. But since I don't have any option other than (1) taking him with me, (2) I don't go to Seoul at all, I am trying my best to figure out the best way to taking him. 

I read several airline policies, and it seem like bringing him is at least not impossible. But I found most airline web pages have only minimal information, making it a hard decision which one is the right one.  If someone had similar experience, and found a certain airline better than others, please let me know.

Regardless of whether he can take on the flight with me or not, It will be a long flight, at least 12 hours. And I am sure this will be such a hard time for him. What can I do to minimize his suffering?

Thank you for reading! Looking forward to get some advice :)",cats,"Has anyone experienced a long international flight (US &lt;-&gt; Korea), especially recently?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/qxx6pq/has_anyone_experienced_a_long_international/,True,submission

Sounds simple enough, except he's always liked dry food much more than canned food, so getting him to eat it was a struggle.  Over the last couple of months it's gotten worse and I noticed he has been losing weight.  Last night I took him back to the vet, and she told me that she thinks he has cancer --lymphoma.

I'm just beside myself.  He's only 11.   I don't know how much longer he will be with me, but it probably won't be long.  He will be the third cat I've lost around 10 - 11 years.  I'm starting to think I'm a curse on these poor cats...if  I adopt you, be prepared to not live past 10-11 years.

He is also the sweetest cat I've ever known.  He used to touch his paw to my face ever-so-gently, somehow patting and stroking my cheek without scratching me.

Waiting and not knowing when or how he might get is killing me.

I'm willing to shell out extra money if the prescription stuff is that necessary and that much higher quality, but I'm also worried that the vet is being paid to shill an unnecessarily expensive brand of cat food. 

Anybody here have experience with this? Can I give something a little less expensive, say, Purina urinary formula or whatever, or should I really keep him on this food forever?

I have a 7 year old male. We adopted him at 1 year old, and apparently in the shelter and in the foster home he was amazing with other cats. Loved them.  My girlfriend and I spent some time in an area with a lot of wildcats who would come to the door and he would always be happy to see them. 

My mom has two cats, both female. One of them has spent time with 4 other cats previously and has gotten along with them all. The other cat is younger, but they get along wonderfully. 

We‚Äôre spending some time at my moms and we figured the cats would get along great. We separated them for a week, swapped scents, used a grate, all that good stuff. Eventually my cat made it clear that he wants to be with them so we integrated them and‚Ä¶ 

Both my moms cats HATE mine. If they see him, they‚Äôll hiss. It hasn‚Äôt changed in more than a month. One of them will tolerate his existence but if he gets anywhere close to her, she‚Äôll hiss and growl. He generally respects her boundaries. 

The other cat is a bit less mean, but their dynamic is confusing where I think she‚Äôs scared of my cat. What generally happens is she‚Äôll hide, make eye contact for a second or two and then run for her life. My cat, upon seeing her run, will chase her around the apartment and they‚Äôll take turns swatting at each other. It always seems like play, but my moms cat is constantly hissing at him while this is going on, mine just doesn‚Äôt care and keeps chasing her anyway. 

My gf seems to think that our male cat is being a bully, but he always seems to be happy go lucky and playful. He never ‚Äúattacks‚Äù them, he never hisses at them, he never gets into fights with them, never uses his claws, etc. It always looks like he‚Äôs playing, but the the girls hate every minute of it.

Especially if your cat is a rescue. Most rescue cats out there have been breeding naturally with other random cats, and there‚Äôs a HUGE pool of breeds in most cats. If a cat doesn‚Äôt come from pedigreed parents, it‚Äôs not a pedigree.
If your cat doesn‚Äôt fit the standard of any cat breed you can find, then yeah, probs doesn‚Äôt have a breed. And that‚Äôs okay. All cats are great and deserve all the love we can give.

Anyway, the soonest I could get them neutered was at 7 and a half months old or 3 weeks ago and when they neutered them they trimmed all of the hair they needed to in order to do so, you know what I mean and I was planning on getting that done soon because one is medium long hair domestic and the other is short hair domestic and I heard it could be painful if you don't trim those areas especially for longer hair cats when they use the restroom and since I've had them they've never had a problem using the litter box and have tried scented litter in the beginning but it was unpleasant for me to be near it and i read that cats dislike scented litter so I can't imagine how bad it must've been for them and started getting Tidy Cats Free and Clean unscented litter for months now which they seemed to like...

They have two litter boxes each that are more than spacious enough for them which I cleaned everyday when they were using it and it's 100% clean now since I've even changed the previous litter and replaced it with new litter in hopes that might work but no luck...

It got really bad this afternoon, where she was really yowling and rolling around on everything. then about 4 hours ago it completely stopped. no more yowling, normal behaviour, no more presenting herself or wiggling. she still hasn't eaten, but she's been much more calm.

So far, I‚Äôve been googling and asking other feline friendly parties their opinions, but we haven‚Äôt gotten many different ideas to work with outside of ‚Äúhigh-end treats‚Äù (no actual brands given) or more toys (they have a ton).

For context on what they‚Äôre like:

M is a *foodie*. He knows when dinner is, he constantly hops on the counter for food, pretty much INHALES anything put in front of him. He‚Äôs very motivated by food. He‚Äôs also 10-11ish pounds (up from 7.5 when we adopted him and his brother).

C is the ‚Äúprince‚Äù of the house: he stands tall and handsome, he prances, he constantly demands immediate attention or he‚Äôll manipulate you by falling to his side and revealing his belly, and he is a *stickler* for never having the same meal twice. He cannot have the same wet food consecutively, but he‚Äôll eat the dry food just fine.

They both love this wand toy we got them when we first adopted them. C actually begs for the thing every single time we approach the toy‚Äôs hiding spot. His brother is much more relaxed and observant, but he‚Äôll play when the toy is out.

This is my first time posting to this subreddit. 

In my apartment complex I noticed there are a lot of stray cats, so I started to feed them food. It's cat food or other safe foods for cats, I made sure to check everything is safe before I feed them. I personally have never owned a cat before, and I actually have a dog at my apartment. So I have no intention of adopting or owning a cat.

To my knowledge these are wild/stray cats that a lot of people in the community feed and they come out from the woods that's near the complex and its blocked by a fence. I usually leave the food by the fence, and I like to watch them eat/enjoy their company. Out of 6 cats that I continuously feed, one in particular has grown a strong liking to me, Busty (because he has a busted ear). I've had up to 5 cats eating before and Busty will come and circle my legs and he's the only cat I've ever pet. Most of them are too skittish and I would never forcefully try to pet or get near a stray cat.   

Busty is always the first cat there for feeding whenever I call for them. Today I was feeding, and he was especially interested in being pet and circling my legs. Two other cats came up and so I went to give them food like I normally do. He got a little upset and was staring at them, but I called him and he went back to normal. Then I tried to show him a little make-shift bed because it's been getting cold. He was following me, but so did one of the other cats (and this cat is the smallest of the 6). He was staring at it and chased it and I think he even scratched it. I heard the small cat scream, but Busty came back to me immediately after he did that. The cat that got hurt also ended up watching from a farther distance and from behind a tree, so I'm not sure if it just sounded worse than it actually was. 

I'm just scared I'm going to cause a problem between the cats if this one continues to grow attached to me. I don't want any of the cats to get hurt. I don't know if this is normal cat behavior, or if I should stop feeding/interacting with them. I just want to make sure they all stay safe. I know if I stop feeding them they will still be able to eat and will be fed by other residents.

TL;DR:  I've been feeding stray cats, one has grown especially fond of me and attacked another stray out of jealousy.

Not to the point where we can't take care of her outside as long as we come in and wash our hands but we could never have a cat inside with us. Before I say anything else I just want say that no matter what we all want is the best and happiest life for Mew (we were doomed as soon as my sister named her lol). That being said, we've fallen in love with her and really would like to keep her as an outdoor cat. We've been diligently searching for her owner for two weeks and no luck. We've tried to find someone we know who could take her (so we could at least see her on occasion) and no luck. She's not cuddly and only likes pets when she wants them. Keep petting her when she doesn't want it and you're fixing to get scratched. She doesn't seem to have any interest in coming inside either. So it's been difficult to find someone who wants her because she's not really suited for completely indoor life. 

The only thing keeping us from just keeping her is because we're afraid she won't have the best possible life as an outdoor only cat. We live in a pretty safe suburban neighborhood but there are a lot of dogs around here who get loose somewhat regularly (believe me, we're working with animal control trying to remedy that but it's a losing battle) and we're in the Midwest so it gets pretty darn cold here in the winter. As much as we love her, and as happy as she seems now, we'd just hate for her to be unhappy or not live the fullest and best life possible. It's a really difficult decision and I'm hoping someone here can give us some advice about whether or not we should keep her and if we do how we can give her the best possible life as an outdoor cat.",cats,Recently my family was chosen by the sweetest stray cat...,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/qwhnf8/recently_my_family_was_chosen_by_the_sweetest/,True,submission

My team and I had to clear out a bunch of our filing cabinets and pack everything at our desks away because our company of moving to an open floor plan since most of us will be primarily virtual.

Then one of day, I was feeding the other other outside cat(s). I heard his distinctive 'meow' and turned and saw him with a devastating leg injury.

I turned and saw the sweet boy. One hind leg horribly mangled. I knew, with one look, that the leg would need to be amputated.

He immediately moved into a carrier. He stunk, like rotted meat. I was scared that the infection had gone far enough to kill him and went quiet.

I was so scared! I called the ER vet, said the rescue site only had an email. She called their contact number.

We got Johnny help and he had an amputation, but he's been ADOPTED!!

I‚Äôve had my cat for almost 5 years and the entire time since I got him he has peed on the floor. Not exclusively, he does use his litterbox, but he consistently picks a few spots in whatever apartment I live in where he will pee regardless of any other factors including how clean the litterbox is. At first it was just if there was a plush rug or carpeting (I literally can no longer live in apartments with any carpeting because of him) but a couple years ago he started also peeing on hardwood and stone/marble flooring. He will even pee on the floor right next to his litterbox no matter how clean it is. This has become a huge problem because whatever room his litterbox is in he kind of turns the whole floor into a litterbox which is nasty. Where I currently live he even has two litterboxes, one on each floor of the house, but still pees on the floor outside both of them.

He has had mild urinary/kidney issues previously including FLUTD and crystals in his urine, but did this prior to being diagnosed and he also had bloodwork done last year that showed no kidney related concerns but has not stopped peeing on the floors. I‚Äôm taking him to the vet for more bloodwork this week, but has anyone successfully trained their cat to stop peeing outside the litterbox? I‚Äôm worried that even if it is a medical issue, he is so used to it at this point he will never stop. I love him dearly and would never give him up, but I want to be able to live in a piss free home again.

From living on the streets for years, he's extremely skittish and fast, and at any loud noise he tries to escape. We keep all three cats indoor only.


Normally we can get him settled, but my family and I will be moving twice within 6 months. The first move is in less than a week to a bungalow that's considerably smaller than our current home while our new house is built. I'm afraid that he's going to try to bolt due to unfamiliarity/wanderlust.


Around April, we'll be moving cross country to a permanant place that no one has been to. This is what really freaks me out, because if he gets loose I'm sure there's no way he'll find his way home, and with no teeth he can't hunt for himself. I've ordered a gps collar, but theres always the fear it'll fall off and I can't find him.

I know this because he needs to play 2-3 times per day, and our play sessions are INTENSE! We have a string type toy that he chases around, and he loves to run up and down our 7ft cat tree, he will do freaking BACKFLIPS to get the toy, he loves play time and it takes 10-20min per play session to tire him out. He doesn't eat all his food, he grazes throughout the day, so I know he is not getting fat, he HAS to be so heavy due to all his muscle build up from play time.

That in particular makes me pretty nervous. I will put him in a harness and can hopefully clip the leash to him to ensure he can't escape. I'm also worried that he will poop on his carrier (he'll be in it for about 6 hours) or just cry so much they won't admit him on the plane.

She got two cats- brother and sister and they adored her. Following her around the house all day as she spoke to them! She would take 2 hour afternoon naps with her, purring and nuzzling into her. They both are very needy and wants lots of cuddles a lot. 

Now that she is gone, they sleep a lot more and one wanders the house meowing. They use to be high energy cats and still get excited and happy sometimes but often they are sitting with this awkward/nervous energy in parts of the house. 

What‚Äôs worse is my Dad is doing bad and feels like he needs to move on from the house and give away the cats in a few months. I would take them but I have a small apartment that (I think) doesn‚Äôt allow pets. Further I have been unhappy with my life for years and was about to make a major life change, and possibly big move. Also I have so much anxiety around the cats I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs emotionally healthy that I keep them. I just am so lost and heart broken about my Mom, but also for these cats that she loved with all her heart and who I love so much too. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. My brother and Dad are not really cat people so I thought coming to this community maybe I could get some advice.",cats,"My Mom died, her cats are not taking it well &amp; it‚Äôs heart breaking.
