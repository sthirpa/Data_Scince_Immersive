## Timeline

- **9am**: Project introduction.
- **10am**: By 10am, answer the [check-in form](https://forms.gle/GBCnMFYPkaPdt8CY9) with the dataset you've chosen.
- **3pm**: 3-minute lightning talks where you walk us through your process. **No slides necessary** -- it's fine if you'd prefer walk us through your Jupyter notebook instead, but remember you only have 3 minutes!
- **5pm**: Make sure your project work has been pushed.

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

## Rubric

This project will be **PASS / FAIL**, so you will receive a grade of **1** or **0**.

## Note

Do not duplicate someone else's analysis and make sure to give credit to any resources you used. :)

Have fun!
