    " Your team works at a FinTech business which is experimenting with incorporating NLP into its performance projections of other companies. The CIO has asked your team to see if it is possible to predict the gross revenue of a company in a given year using the non-numeric information in their previous year's 10-K (Annual Report). Achieving the most accurate possible predictions is your only objective.\n",

    "Your team works at a video game developer. Their leading title, an MMORPG, has been plagued by bot accounts which are used to harvest resources en masse to be transferred to real players, leading to destabilization of the player-to-player markets. The player experience team would like you to develop a model which predicts whether an account is being controlled by a human or a program based on timestamped logs of their interactions with the world. Because the market instability associated with these accounts is causing major player disatisfaction and churn, they don't care how you arrive at your predictions as long as they are highly accurate.\n",
