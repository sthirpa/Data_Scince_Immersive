# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Neural Network Mini-hackathon Fashion MNIST ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘”

## Goal

Create the highest scoring model to classify clothing images!


## Instructions

In a notebook on Kaggle (or Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, but give Kaggle a try first!), prepare your data, create and train your model, and evaluate it with a validation split. The training data is [fashion-mnist_train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_train.csv).

- Use Tensorflow Keras.
- Don't forget to use a GPU or TPU Accelerator to speed up your training! (top right drop-down in Kaggle notebook interface) ðŸš€
- There are lots of model architectures and hyperparameters you can tune. See what gives you the best validation score.

Then create predictions for the [test set](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_test.csv). These should be numbers in the range 0-9. DROP THE LABEL COLUMN FIRST! âš 

- Do NOT use other people's Kaggle Kernels.

- Hint: create a simple model that trains fast before training more complicated models.

- Feel free to create a confusion matrix to see how your model performs on different articles of clothing.

- Lightning presentations.

    After ~3 hours, or some other time specified by your instructors, we'll reconvene and your group will do a ~3 minute walk-through of your analysis. Assume the audience here is your classmates and instructors, to keep it simple.


From Kaggle:

> Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

> The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

## Have fun and good luck! ðŸš€
