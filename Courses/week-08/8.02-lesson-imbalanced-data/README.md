Today, we'll cover techniques for:

- Organizing larger projects.
- Handling class imbalance.
- Optimizing models for precision/recall rather than accuracy.

There are no solution notebooks. Because this is a larger project than usual, all code is contained inside the lessons.


## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

1. Utilize external Python files and pickling to organize larger projects.
2. Explain the use of recall and precision in evaluating model performance.
3. Explain techniques for dealing with class imbalance.
4. Practice maximizing recall while balancing precision, instead of maximizing accuracy.
