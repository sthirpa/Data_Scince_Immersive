## Additional Resources
### Command Line and Git Resources:
- [**The Unix Shell, by Software Carpentry**](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/): For our class, maybe only sections 1-4 are important. The remaining sections (5-7) are also great, but we probably won't need them.

### Python Resources
- [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com): A free online book that is 50% _really good Python tutorial_ and 50% content on how to use Python in new and incredibly interesting ways. It is one of my favorite technological books of all time. -Tim Book
