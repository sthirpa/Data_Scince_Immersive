- **Required Preparation** will include installing new packages, downloading data, and so on. This is required.
- **Optional Prework** will contain videos, reading, and other resources that may help prepare you for the following week's content. This is optional, but it is recommended that you review the materials shared here!

## Required Preparation:
- None!

## Optional Prework:
As shared in [week 3's prereading](../03-regression/prep-and-reading.md), there is a book called “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R.” (ISLR) While the exercises are in R instead of Python, it’s a very good book that walks through many of the machine learning algorithms and topics we’ll discuss in the class. It’s available for free (legally!) online as a .pdf here: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf

Someone has translated the activities from R into Python; you can [see the Github repo here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python).

In ISLR, the following sections are recommended reading.
#### Chapter 2: Statistical Learning
- Section 2.1 (What is Statistical Learning)
- Section 2.2 (Assessing Model Accuracy)

#### Chapter 4: Classification
- Section 4.1 (An Overview of Classification)
- Section 4.2 (Why Not Linear Regression?)
- Section 4.3 (Logistic Regression)

#### Chapter 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization
- Section 6.2 (Regularization)

Since this week was our first big foray into modeling, we covered a lot of stuff that’s important: train/test split, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff, feature engineering, and the like. You might find it helpful to go back and do some of the [pre-reading from week 3](../03-regression/prep-and-reading.md) now that you’ve seen all of these concepts.
