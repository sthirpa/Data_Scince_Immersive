# **Background:**

We are working with a portfolio company within the retail space. The company operates a distributed
footprint of stores and while the company has successfully scaled its operation, the CEO believes that
there are still inefficiencies within the system. As the business looks to expand, it is important to
understand key drivers of success and potential areas to improve upon. You are the data scientist that
will help to inform this understanding and in turn, drive the company’s go-forward strategy. 

To help
facilitate this analysis, you have been provided with historical operating data for all locations over the
last year – please use only this dataset in your analysis.

 You are free to use any programming language
to analyze this data. Please save all work and provide all code along with your response.

### **Part 1 – Summary statistics and plots:**
1) Looking across all locations, calculate the mean and median annual profit margin of a typical
store. Does the profit margin across locations appear normally distributed? Please visualize.
2) Please plot the monthly and quarterly aggregate revenue across all stores.

### **Part 2 – Cleaning the data:**

You will have noticed that the company operates both owned and leased locations. This creates an
apples-to-oranges comparison, as only the leased locations are burdened with rental cost. To prep your
data for analysis, please impute an appropriate rental cost for each owned location and recalculate the
rent-adjusted annual profit margin.


### **Part 3 – Quantify drivers of success:**

With the data now cleaned, please identify factors that have led to historical outperformance across
locations. The CEO is principally focused on maximizing profit margin at each location. There is no single
correct answer for this section. We are more interested in your problem-solving process than any
singular answer.
In response to the CEO’s question, please write a concise email describing your findings and put
together two slides that you can use to walk them through the analysis.
