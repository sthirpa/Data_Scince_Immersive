    ">You might get the impression that neural networks only understand the most useful features, but that’s not entirely true. Neural networks scoop up all the features available and give them random weights. During the training process, the neural network adjusts these weights to reflect their importance and how they should impact the output prediction. The patterns with the highest appearance frequency will have higher weights and are considered more useful features. Features with the lowest weights will have very little impact on the output (Mohammed 32)."
