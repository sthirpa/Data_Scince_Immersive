- **Required Preparation** will include installing new packages, downloading data, and so on. This is required.
- **Optional Prework** will contain videos, reading, and other resources that may help prepare you for the following week's content. This is optional, but it is recommended that you review the materials shared here!

## Required Preparation:

None!

## Optional Prework:
If you want to pre-read for next week, read the following [from ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf):
- 5.2 - The Bootstrap. (You'll want to know the bootstrap well as it will be embedded in methods we'll discuss next week.)
- Chapter 8 - Tree Based Methods. (We'll learn about classification and regression trees, random forests, bagging and boosting next week.)
- 9.1-9.5 (Support Vector Machines and related methods)

Since this content can be math-heavy, practicing math concepts with [the NumPy ladder](./6.02-lab-numpy-ladder-challenge-main) may be helpful.
