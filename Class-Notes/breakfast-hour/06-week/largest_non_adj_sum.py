Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of two non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([2, 4, 6, 8])
12

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([5, 1, 1, 5])
10

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([2, 4, 6, 3, 8, 9])
15

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([1, 2])
2

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([1])
1

>>> largest_non_adj_sum([])
0

def largest_non_adj_sum(array):

    # Replace the line below with all your code. Remember to return the requested data.
    pass
