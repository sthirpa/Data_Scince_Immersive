    "A feature in machine learning is an individual measurable property or characteristic of an observed phenomenon. Features are the input that you feed to your ML model to output a prediction or classification. Suppose you want to predict the price of a house: your input features (properties) might include `square_foot`, `number_of_rooms`, `bathrooms`, and `so on`, and the model will output the predicted price based on the values of your features. Selecting good features that clearly distinguish your objects increases the predictive power of ML algorithms. <br> - In Computer Vision, a feature is a measurable piece of data in your image that is unique to that specific object. It may be a distinct color or a specific shape such as a line, edge, or image segment. A good feature is used to distinguish objects from one another (Mohammed)."
