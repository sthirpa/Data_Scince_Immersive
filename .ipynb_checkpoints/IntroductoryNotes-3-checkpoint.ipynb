    "A feature in machine learning is an individual measurable property or characteristic of an observed phenomenon. Features are the input that you feed to your ML model to output a prediction or classification. Suppose you want to predict the price of a house: your input features (properties) might include `square_foot`, `number_of_rooms`, `bathrooms`, and `so on`, and the model will output the predicted price based on the values of your features. Selecting good features that clearly distinguish your objects increases the predictive power of ML algorithms. <br> - In Computer Vision, a feature is a measurable piece of data in your image that is unique to that specific object. It may be a distinct color or a specific shape such as a line, edge, or image segment. A good feature is used to distinguish objects from one another (Mohammed)."

    ">It is common to periodically insert a Pooling layer in-between successive Conv layers in a ConvNet architecture. Its function is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. The Pooling Layer operates independently on every depth slice of the input and resizes it spatially, using the MAX operation.

    ">Pooling layer downsamples the volume spatially, independently in each depth slice of the input volume. Left: In this example, the input volume of size [224x224x64] is pooled with filter size 2, stride 2 into output volume of size [112x112x64]. Notice that the volume depth is preserved. Right: The most common downsampling operation is max, giving rise to max pooling, here shown with a stride of 2. That is, each max is taken over 4 numbers (little 2x2 square).Pooling layer downsamples the volume spatially, independently in each depth slice of the input volume.
